			<RelCText>Like Dracula said; buy; dont rent...but for that price; you can go to Obeidly (in Sofitel)...but i think they have older cars. Some running alright but i would avoid them. They do have some good prices on the newer cars though. Just dont rent from Petra. They have lousy cars and they rip their clients off. The charge their credit cards without consent and then refuse to help settle the issue.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>For family with 2 child; you ll probably need 2BR flat which will cost about 7000-8000 and for schooling you ll probably need 4000-5000. so it means these two will take major chunk of your salary.

			<RelCText>Aamirjaved's calculation is somewhat on the high side. I believe you should be able to get a 2BR within QR 5000 and also you can easily manage your monthly expenses within QR 2000.

			<RelCText>We can't say if it's a good deal - you don't include details of the role. Try to get schooling included in the package. Agree with aamirjaved. Depends on what standard of living you want. Depending on area; you may need 10k+ for a nice 2 bed.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>I think it will depend on what kind of lifestyle you want here; what nationality are you? If you are western I would say you wont save much out of 20k; you would want a decent apartment / villa; good social life; weekends away. If you are the sort of person who is just coming here to work work work; then you will be able to save more. It will be trial and error until you find the balance that suits you and the lifestyle you want to have.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>I see a lot of people have already written a reasonable answer; but keep in mind following: - about flat or car rental - depends who negotiates. If a European person or a westerner in general - forget it to find those rates. For them everything is double. - as many have mentioned - depends on lifestyle. For example one of the most difficult issues for women here - to find a normal hairdresser; beautician; etc. usually too expensive and very low quality / level of hygiene. If you go to a normal place - prices are ridiculous for what you get.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Because there are not too much specialty stores that caters only professional cameras (DSLRs). Mostly camera stores can be found only in malls but they are not specialty stores. You know how mall owners jack-up prices of goods; especially if it comes or imported outside Doha. If you have friends in UAE; you can ask them to buy you one and just shipped it you. Or; there are some people selling DLSRs here in QL. You can search the classified ad here.</RelCText>

So indirect 5k per month would be the rent. then car if you go for high end car apprx starting from 100000 to 123000 then monthy EMI would be between 4000 to 4500. then food and other expensies..Now it is totallly depend on how you spend it dude.

			<RelCText>It depends on your living standard and expectation for savings. In this connection it is important to know do all allowances (specialy accomodation allowance) are included or not in this amount.

			<RelCText>I think the camera might have flashed for someone else who had crossed the red signal completely which you did not notice. I am staying near the crazy and there are a lot of similar sudden breaks where most of the vehicles are sometimes crossing their front wheels and I have not seen any camera flashes for them.

			<RelCText>I have been flashed twice at the Toyota Tower Signals for jumping the red light but luckily the cameras are still in the testing phase. Not all those ugly speed cameras are fully operational. They havent all yet been connected to the ministry of interior's sever. Once I was behind a truck at a signal and I couldnt see whether it was green or red when I was crossing. These huge trucks block the sight of the signals. They have to do something about it. Anyways I would definitely advise people not to jump redlights and slow down at the singals.</RelCText>

Can the prsent employer of the wife play havoc ? ..Can he stop her doing so ?....

			<RelCText>correct... just follow what darude's suggest... 1> get married. 2> once handed the marriage documents; let your wife to ask from his current Sponsor to change sponsorship to HUSBAND SPONSORSHIP; u may do that instantly or upon expiry of you wife's visa. your wife can still continue with her current job without leaving the country. 3>ask for Mandoub services to do the job; it is only a simple paperwork to change sponsorship. 4>if your wife wishes to quit the job; she may do so... so many reasons to tell the previous sponsor for quiting the job like she is pregnant... after giving birth reasons like she needs to care for you infant. ~~~ There is no substitute for victory yet there is risks of too much oversight... ~~~</RelCText>

You need to apply this in the labor department (i don't know if process had changed); with your husband's NOC from company allowing him to sponsor you; degree certificate attested by DFA; Embassy and MOI; 6 months bank statement; Labour contract and company ID.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>very rarely private companies give an NOC . 5 in 100. now for example; if you look for a new job and then ask for an NOC; ur boss will say no it is not our policy and he will doubt at u and will remove u from the company and then choice but ban for 2 years. in my case i got the NOC first and then looked for a job. now u mentioned they do not have an idea then u should check in a very political way with ur boss if they give NOC. believe me go step by step. again i say check with ur boss first for an noc and then look for another job</RelCText>

			<RelCText>without government approval of your marriage; you won't get a family visa back into Qatar; unfortunately. Marrying you out of the country can cause major problems for your fiance; so I would suggest you wait until your marriage is approved. The only other option is that you relocate somewhere else; marry there; but your marriage will not be valid in Qatar; and you will have no claim to any inheritences if god forbid; something should happen to him. Does your fiance not have some Wasta; that can obtain your release from your company? I am not saying that will make things any easier; since you still need to have the govt approval for marriage; but at least you can be in Qatar; near him.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Kat yep very true about the type of work you are experienced in; if the position can be filled local the mindset is.....why hire a American that will want more salary then a different nationality? Wasta; I have but lol kat i dont have the right wasta so im out of here. even with a catchy; professional cv it all came down to wrong visa. lol and they say being American with upon arrival visa is transferable.... ya right.... Can u be my wasta? It is EASY if you are on husbands rp; just need patience as this is Qatar they move slow in HR; but they get over 100+ applications a day. IF your CV is eye catching and has what they need; you will get a call for interview.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>its quiet; but you can find things to do if you really want to. Now..being happy will depend on a lot of things; to be honest. Are you single..do you have a very active night life...etc... I don't have a curfew..I think that might depend upon what job you have and the requirements. Active night life..there is one but its limited. I see you are from the UK..will be honest with you and say its nothing like the pub scene back there. Clubs and pubs are located ONLY in hotels. Easy to get around if you drive..but you have to be aggressive in your driving manner and defensive...;) I just like it here; for many many reasons...but you DO need to look at all the perspectives before coming here. ONE main one is that the riyal is pegged to the dollar..NOT the English Pound...</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Dr. fawaz on al waab street I absolutely would not recommend if you start getting problems after 9:30 pm; you will be referred to HMC; and if you are not registerred their it will take more time; best is to stick to HMC. Actually any clinic is not suitable; they are unable to provide the care you need when complications start; you will need tyo go to an hospital.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>First; you have to be 100 % sure if you are preggy or not. Go to the hospital a.s.a.p so you can have a pregnancy blood test. Better go early so you can wait for the result within 1-2 hours. They will ask you prior to that if you are married the say YES; since you are really married right? 2nd - Does your employer knows that your husband is in town or not? If they know that he is here; then leave it as it is. Have you mention to your employer or interviewers before that you are married? Or have submitted a marriage contract as part of the HR formalities?.. Then leave it again. Then just go on with your pregnancy and do your best to invite your husband to come back in DOHA. Further; Make sure that you are living with your trusted friends or relatives to avoid rumors; etc.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>"'kaliwali""... don't be scared; We are only allowed to be scared to GOD and no one else. You go to Phil. Embassy and apply for the authentication of ur Marriage Contract. Then go to Qatar Ministry (somewhere in Corniche) sorry can't figure out the exact name of this gov't agency. Show them the authenticated marriage contract and they will stamp that contract (arabic text). So at least you are protected with that paper. Anytime somebody ask you then just show the paper;to keep their mouth shut. Keep on praying don't stress yourself too much as you are entering the most memorable and exciting stage of womanhood. Just trust and believe in GOD. It's not easy but you must do something as early as now. Hope this will help you."</RelCText>

No matter which hospital you go for consultation; make sure you visit Women's Hospital ASAP and create your file out there which will help the doctors in case of emergency. Before visit Women's hospital; make sure you carry your ID and your husbands ID along with Passport or marriage certificate. All the best and may God bless you with all the health and strength.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>"Hi ditto; Sorry to estate the obvious and if I sound a little patronasing; but couldn't your back pain be related to the fact that you are pregnant??? If so I think is best if you leave it untreated; I used to have a lot of pain in my back too and it dissapeared after giving birth. It is normal; it doesn't mean that there is something ""wrong"" with your back. Anyways; there are lots of doctors here. The Hammad women hospital is very good and have modern equipment; I was treated there.. I also heard very good things about Al Emadi and the Doha Clinic. I did try the American Hospital and didn't like it at all. Women Hospital: 439 6666 Al Emadi: 466 6009 Doha Clinic: 432 7300 Doha Chripractic Centre: 4650012 HOpe that helps."</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Actually i wasn't really very clear in my message cuz i didn't think it was necessary to give a lot of details; but now that u ask; the fact is i am not pregnant yet but i want to have another baby. However; I've had back problems since my first pregnancy which was over 2 years ago; so my problem is do i try to fix my back first or go ahead and get pregnant which will probably cause more back problems then afterwards start treating my back. Thanks for the phone numbers; i already have these; i was hoping to get names of doctors people actually tried; cuz my experience here hasn't been so great.

			<RelCText>hello ditto; i do think you need to see a chiropractor; and if you do have back pain of course it means there is something wrong with your back. SInce you are pregnant your pelvis is expanding which causes pain in your lumbar and pelvic also due to the extra weight. Therefore the best treatment for you is chiropractic; its not only for your back pain but also for optimum health of the baby and you.The chiropractic approach to better health is to detect;reduce;and help pervent nervous system dysfunction.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Same goes for Doha Clinic. If anything goes wrong; tha ambulance's are rushed to Hamad Medical. Why risk it?

			<RelCText>Thanks you all for the responses; althought i must say that i've been quite worry about some comments. Are you people sure about those things (that a ahli don't have NICU)?? Did you actually gave birth on hamad or other hospital to say that or this is like that kind of stuff that you hear somebody saying and reapeat as if was realy truth?? I'm asking because chosing a hospital/doctor far away from your home country is a very dificult decision; and al ahli hospital doesn't look like the kind of place you described. I like to hear from someone who actually delivered there. Is there anyone?? Thanks</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Her first three were at Hamad Medical and her last child was born in Al Ahli ONLY because she wanted her husband to attend the delivery. she compared all four deliveries and decided never to go back to Al Ahli. They are rude and broke her water - without her approval. She was emotionally and phsycologically abused by the nurses there. They wouldn't call her doctor when she was asked them to. We had to call her from our personal mobiles. Not a very pleasant experience. I'm having all my children at Hamad Medical.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>"Dr S; I have checked with a friend doctor at Hamad Hospital; and these are some feedbacks that I gather : 1. HMC plans to become a full fledged Specialist Hospital soon; therefore they don't take in Residents anymore. Anyway; there is an exception to this...if you're enrolling the ""Arab Board"" Program; you'll be appointed as Resident. ""Arab Board"" is a 4-year program to become Specialists. 2. To enroll the Arab Board; HMC together with Weill Cornell Medical College conducts a yearly entrance exam (normally in Sept). In the recent exam; the passing mark was 55. 3. Salary for Resident is about QR 8;200/month (excluding Housing). 4. If you have relevant experience and qualifications; you will either be appointed Clinical Associate/ Specialist/ Consultant."</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Kat yep very true about the type of work you are experienced in; if the position can be filled local the mindset is.....why hire a American that will want more salary then a different nationality? Wasta; I have but lol kat i dont have the right wasta so im out of here. even with a catchy; professional cv it all came down to wrong visa. lol and they say being American with upon arrival visa is transferable.... ya right.... Can u be my wasta? It is EASY if you are on husbands rp; just need patience as this is Qatar they move slow in HR; but they get over 100+ applications a day. IF your CV is eye catching and has what they need; you will get a call for interview.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>I am not sure on what condition you are going to move to Doha; but it looks like both of you guys don't have a job in Qatar... So actually you have to star from searching job. As has been mentioned; try to browse Internet for the advertismenets. Then you can get phone/fax numbers and e-mails of particular hotels; and send your CVs directly to these hotels. When you find the job; the Comapany will issue visa for you; and only after that you can come to Qatar.

			<RelCText>A number of my tuition students are from Parkhouse. There seems to be little support for those who lag behind in a particular subject. Also the number of UK qualified teachers with QTS (Qualified Teacher Status) is limited. You may wish to ask how many of the teachers actually have QTS compared to those that don't. Many of the teachers are not from the UK and do so not have a background of teaching a British Curriculum. Finally; Parkhouse only follows part of the National Curriculum of England and Wales. The rest of the curriculum is based around what is referred to as the International Curriculum; which is created by a private company in the UK and is not endorsed by the government. This topic has been discussed a number of times previously so you may wish to do a search to get a better idea of the school. You may also wish to try other UK curriculum schools such as Doha College; DESS; Sherborne and the International School of London. Good luck.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Joe90 Not sure how qualified you are to comment on the status of the teachers at Park House school. ALL their teacher comply with SEC conditions on qualifications of their teachers; otherwise they would not be able to operate! I can confirm the vast majority of teachers at the school are British; 2nd is South African (excellent standard of educated teachers) and other nationalities. The school is as british as it gets in a non-british country. The standards are extremely high. There is very positive school/parent contact and all pupils are expected to work hard; are well disciplined; and result focused. I am british and my children attend Park House. I would have no problem with them returning to the UK (not likely with the current working conditions in the UK!) and slipping into very good schools and coping with the change. If you are typical middle class parents who discipline your children and make sure they stay on top of their studies you will reap the benefit of this school which.....</RelCText>

			<RelCText>As a user of the Qatari and British education systems for my children let me tell you that if you have a good teacher; your child and you are lucky! Usually here about 1 in 5 teachers have that power to inspire YOUR child! Be glad when you get one; no matter what school they are paid by!

			<RelCText>Craftyqueen; let me tell you that all the children who are not as good in reading as the rest of their colleagues are taken away from their normal classes; given to a volunteer parent (who is given a bunch of flashcards with no further instructions) who is supposed to help them develop reading skills. Not only is that wrong; but on top of it they miss what is happening in their class. And don't try and tell me it's not true - I was a volunteer parent last schoolyear for Year 1. Is this the way to save on spending more time with the children who need more reading practice? Why not do like the French School - extra hours of tuition after school? Last swimming competition the kids were so excited to show what they could do - instead the swimming teacher used her own son to get a better place for Park House. The amount of dissapointed faces of children was heartbreaking! Waiting hours for nothing? Things are far less positive then what you make them seem!</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Alumnar I am surprised you are willing to say negative comments about the school your children attend on QL. Maybe you should change schools for your kids and give those parents who would remove their right arm to put their kids into Park House their place. In the UK all primary schools ask parents to come into the lower primary classes to hear the children read. I can't understand what could be better than one-to-one reading. If you want to suggest a reading group after school which parents fund I am sure the school would be interested in your suggestion. In the Uk books were changed once a week - here in Park House its three times a week; their books are set based on their individual ability into small groups if possible. The teacher hears the pupil read at least once a week. Parents are asked to participate in their child's learning by listening to their child read at home. Schooling is not a vacuum - a child can learn at anytime anywhere. As for fairness - the World is not fair and.....</RelCText>

			<RelCText>"Some of the comments that have been made on this thread are more than a little misleading. For example; are we comparing Parkhouse (or any other school in Doha) with fee-paying; independent schools in the UK or are we trying to compare them with state schools in Britain? As Parkhouse is a fee-paying school; I would have thought that the former would be a fairer point of comparison. One person has written that the standards at Parkhouse are ""extremely high"". Well; if there is an acute shortage of school places; then it stands to reason that some of the more popular schools can be very selective about who they allow in through the gates. I have not heard much about Parkhouse's Special Educational Needs policies and I suspect that they would not want to admit SEN children because that might affect their ""extremely high standards"". That also might explain Parkhouse's preference for nice; white English children. Craftyqueen has mentioned the SEC; the Supreme Council of Education. This is a ....."</RelCText>

Shared accomodation = shared food + shared communication expenses + shared expense over sightseeing or going out.

			<RelCText>Don't hate me diamondgirl....this certainly does not apply to everyone....but my personal experience here in doha is that MOST do not speak english. Even people who are not local and come from the subcontinent and claim to speak english do not understand you or prove able to articulate their thoughts in english. I'm not trying to upset anyone; but i'm calling it like I see it. This is a true story: I called the information number provided on the Qatar Foundation website to get some information on the American universities you hear so much hype about; and was shunted through 4 different people who could not speak english! This isn't an obscure gvt office in the ministry of islamic studies or whatever....this was QATAR Foundation!! SO: No! English is not a main language in Qatar...and is mostly spoken by the European and North American Expat communities only. Stay safe all. Perfection does not exist. The question therefore; is: what level of imperfection are we willing to settle for?</RelCText>

Wen I go to a shope and there is and Indian salesman I have to aske at least three times what he is saying ans this is meant seriously; there are other whose English is wonderful. Most people in Government positions are well versed in English although I have to admit we there are a nuber of employees who speak very little English. You seem to have encountered the very few that don't speak english. May I add this comment here; many more Arabs speak English than English speaking races speak Arabic.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Once you are done w/ ur medical exam you can check w/ the medical commission at least after 3 working days. Just show your receipt number or passport copy at the male counter section and you'll get to know if its ready or not. For a medical employees it usually takes about 2 wks to have the results done due to other test (e.i. creatinine test) that has to be sent to HMC for investigations. In your case; you are only required to undergo blood test(HIV) &amp; Chest X-ray(PTB); so i think it wont take long that much. Dont you have mandoop/representative for your company? he is supposed to follow up all these things and you can always check w/ him. Good Luck!</RelCText>

			<RelQBody>Ok guys I am going to prehaps ticks someone off again but I have a question; not Sunny but me. Will a Qatari man go out with a western Christian girl; have sex with her and then move on because he think women from the west are wild and sex craved. Sunny has received quite a bit response from Qatari men who want to date her once we arrive; I even got an offer myself. But I believe it is a trap and I tell Sunny be careful. Any advice out there?</RelQBody>

			<RelCText>It is a very rare Qatari man that would want anything more than what you just described. It is a very rare man in Qatar that wants anything more to do with a Western girl than you just described. Meeting men here is like stepping through a minefield. 9 out of 10 of them just want sex. And they will do and say anything to get it from you. I am not bitter; I do not hate men; but I have been living in various parts of Asia for the last 2 and a half years. Trust me when I say if you do not want to get burned be VERY careful who you date. Asian opinion of Western women is not very high when it comes to sex and dating. Tell Sunny to stop advertising online for a date and come here and get the lay of the land first.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>I must tell you redcajun504 Arab youths can go to any extent to get sex; but so is men from any country. Men have always sex on mind. It is always advisable to be cautious. But why are you worrying? There is a huge expat population here; which includes Indians; Europeans; Americans and even Australians. So; it's not a problem basically. Ask Sunny to be prudent and approach the things casually; without any pre-conceived notions; though caution is utmost required. You never know you may actually get a gem of person among these Arabians. After all; many of them have married Westerners. But dohagirl as such is correct that youths here always look for sex. On my own experience I must tell you they see Russians; Lebanese and Filipinos as someone always available for sex. Actually; this part of the world has many prostitutes from these communities; thronging star hotels. Use your common sense and things will be cozier for you. I wish you and your sister best of luck.

			<RelCText>Life is not easy if you are a Western Woman; and the main reason a man from this part of the world would want a western woman is mainly for sex. However; please do not for one moment think that the men and women here con't have premarital relationships - they do it just not talked about and it is not caried out in the open. Due to the conservative background of the boys they will always return to their families and it would be vry difficult for them to marry outside the families would not be happy about it. I think it is much better to be very cautious out here although there are a great many handsome men and they can be very charming going through the Arab and Asian world of men they are all interested in SEX. One of the things is that being found to be together whoc ae not married can get into very deep trouble here - just a little food for thought.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Sadly this has been the case for many years. Maybe it originally stems from the days when arabs had loads of money; visited capital cities (mainly in the West) and were naturally surrounded (as they were rich) by hookers. Word spread when they returned that they had been with western women. The assumption would then be made that all Western women were loose. That is the assumption that we came to many years ago. Rather like the Western men going to Thailand</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Thanks dweller..You have been fair.. DG..your point is sensible..I tried to see if the shoes fit on the other foot..and its same..Ironical?? (LOL...) It is a very rare Western man that would want anything more than what you just described. It is a very rare man in the West that wants anything more to do with a Asian girl than you just described. Its impossible to believe that the thousands of crippled shaking 70 year old Western men moving with 21 year old Asian beauties do so...because the guy was so romantic; loving and responsible that the girl fell head over heals in love with him.. I have seen Western men in various parts of Asia for the last 2 and a half years. Trust me when I say if you do not want to get burned be VERY careful who you date. Western opinion of Asian women is not very high when it comes to sex and dating.

On my 2mb connection I get around 2.8mb download. __________________________ Cost of Living; Visas; Safety Info; Tips on Moving; Facts; Pictures; Videos; and more!</RelCText>

			<RelCText>"vpn or proxy services provide a dedicated encrypted private link to a server somewhere else in the world. Then you connect via the vpn server to the internet. they charge a monthly fee and there are many to choose from. Some give options of which country to connect to. This helps where online services only work if you are ""IN"" the relevant country (i.e. so BBC online TV thinks you are in UK)"</RelCText>

			<RelCText>"DW; not sure if it will affect your speed or not. Depends on too many things along the ""pipe"" it guess. It could help the ports issue; but as I said earlier I have no issue with UTorrent on the normal DSL so have not moved to fibre yet. It definitely helps with the ""waving finger"" on blocked websites. You can try one of the VPNs for a month - I think prices are around $10 - I used www.overplay.net a while ago. It was easy to pay with paypal (and then stop the subscription via paypal)"</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Less or more; piracy is everywhere. Don't say that only Indians are doing this. The software you mentioned to download audio/video stuff and books from the internet; certainly would not be from India and the stuff that is copied on Torrents (as I mentioned in an earlier thread) is also not copied by Indians only. Most of the tools to get pirated stuff online are invented in those developed countries where giant software companies are battling against piracy in underdeveloped countries. So; don't blame a particular country. Just fight against Piracy as it is illegal and not good; no matter where is it.

			<RelCText>"Torrents ... Use ""uTorrent"" as your torrents client .. Use something like ""www.mininova.org"" or any other website that has loads of torrents on it .. it is not the fastest way sometimes; but the most guaranteed free one ... Good Luck ..."</RelCText>

			<RelCText>"King is right. Utorrent (www.utorrent.com) is the best and simplest torrent client. Once downloaded you just need to install it and then use the search engine on the top right hand side of the interface to search for whatever you want to download (i.e just type the name of the movie). It will take you the mininova.org and once there it is a good idea to sort the findigs by clicking on the heading SEEDS. This will sort it so the movie or program with the highest number of seeders will show first. This guarantees you a higher speed as ""higher number of seeders = greater speed"". Hope this helps. Other good sites are: demonoid.com torrentz.com torrent.to but the one i use for movies is: www.torrentfive.com"</RelCText>

			<RelCText>And of course; it depends on your ADSL speed provided by Qtel. The Fastest ADSL speed for home use available is 2 Mbps; which means you can download up to 256 KB per second as a maximum when your line is idle. Check my page here; I made a small table listing the three different ADSL speeds provided by Qtel for home use. http://ilovesarah.us (scroll to bottom to see table)</RelCText>

			<RelCText>agree to pal... if u want faster; legal ownership of movies; u buy it. but ofcourse there's some for promotional; personal and education use... it's all up to you on how you treat those movies u download. also; it depends on wat type of movies; mostly new and current ones are basically illegal; but for those old but goodies are somehow permitted to share online. for those type of movies; i suggests two things: first; for online viewing... there are youtube; veoh; google videos; megavideo; joox; supernovatube; imeem etc. that u could check and watch some movies second; u could download it (as this is what you ask for right?) using different methods; some like; you could use website assistance like keepvid; clipnabber; file2hd; splandoo; downloadflv; mediapirate; feelingtea; video downloader; and many more to check from. just copy and paste the link of video you required to those website and press ok or get or whatever it mentioned there then the original link of the movie will be shown......</RelCText>

			<RelCText>MFX is right; axxo movies are the best and ... Pal; the arguments about the torrents never end ... They say that the guy who uploaded the movie obtained a legal copy and purchase that and then he is free to do whatever with it; copy it or destroy it or throw it in the garbage ... So if there is someone to be questioned then it should be the one who upload it; not the people downloading the movies. One more thing; 140 Q.R for an original DVD ???

			<RelCText>I've been there a few times already; but always in a group of at least 4 cars. I can tell you that some of my friends keep their cars on 2WD mode most of the times. But I consider these guys very experienced as they only needed to use the 4WD mode when getting someone out of trouble. My old boss even had to drive back (in an Isuzu Trooper; mind you) from deep within the inland sea only on 2WD because the gear-box malfunctioned. So; I stand with TB that it can be done but will not risk it myself.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>You have to follow the Manual from the Car Manufacturer. That is why they made the car and they have studied for a decade. If you have or you own the Car you can make and experiment of your own; buddy... Let say every 3000 Kms of running you have to change oil; or there is some sound you have notice then you have to visit to the service centers for checkup.

If your sponsor is powerful and your job is important you might get away with it. Otherwise you may have to go to jail for one to four weeks and then you will be deported.

			<RelCText>kept getting these phone calls from this woman asking for Cindy...Kept saying no; wrong number...After 3rd call; she got really upset; so I asked what number she was dialing; she said the number she was calling and it wasn't mine..but then I got a wild thought and asked her where her daughter lived (same apt complex as mine) asked had she just moved in (just that morning) and then...the apartment number...(she hesitated; then said; 1411; Mine was 1114) Dumb phone company had gotten the apartments mixed up; crossing the lines. I had to go to the girl's apt and tell her to call her mom!

			<RelQSubject>is it ok?</RelQSubject>
			<RelQBody>hi QLers; please advice. my friends' boyfriend came to visit here in qatar around 2 months ago. now my friend is worried she had a positive pregnancy test but might be having a miscarriage. She had spotting and severe abdominal pain. Can she go to a gynecologist for check up? Would she be questioned why she's pregnant when she's not married? Please advice. thanks.</RelQBody>

But i'm wishing you luck if you get good treatment as my husband had witnessed how they treat ran away maid.

			<RelCText>from my experience; no matter how flamboyantly u dress up; its NOTHING compared to the Qatari ladies there. god; they r all so gorgeous; and their way of dressing up is amazing. cant afford (lol) ;)) abt the gift; no u dont take a gift to the wedding. usually i visit them few days after the wedding; n give a gift. wat happens during a weddin? well; make sure u sit away from the loudspeakers placed at all corners of the hall :-)) u can dance if u want; to the arabic songs being played there. hhhmmm;; n the food part; its yummy. u can starve for a few days after that to lose all those calories earned on that one evenin:-) its fun; ENJOY!!

			<RelCText>Unfortunately; I have found Qatari weddings to be a bit depressing... I have yet to see it as a joyous occassion... I have been to a few in the last few months; and have been very disappointed.  The ladies seem to be competing with each other in the dress department; and so some outfits are very outlandish... There seems to be so much politics amongs the different groups of ladies sitting at the tables; you know.. this group doesn't like that group; or this part of the family feel snubbed for some reason.... The bride ALWAYS looks terrified and a bit like a geisha girl for all the make- up on her face.  I really feel sorry for her.  One of the brides I saw; took about 30 min to walk down the isle in front of us as I don't think she could move with the dress she was wearing....   And you are right about the mobile thing... I had mine with me in the hall (it had been with me the whole night... I had to answer a phone call; and all of a sudden my phone was snatched out of my.....</RelCText>

			<RelCText>"Here's the content of the thread; You are probably all aware by now that there are new dress regulations in place in Qatar - the 4 and 5 star hotels were given 10 days to comply with the new rules which are that you must be ""appropriately dressed"" - no explanation of what this is but it seems to be no knees (even at night in nightclubs etc) and no shoulders. I've heard of people being refused entry to restaurants for having slits up their dresses and (in the case of a 14 year old) showing their knees. I've been told the shopping centres are also now turning people away for wearing halter necks etc (Landmark in particular). One friend just rang me to say that a group of her girlfriends were stopped from going into W last weekend - each of them had something ""inappropriate"" from cleavage; to knees to shoulders. You also have to now show either your ID card or passport for entry into bars and (the scary part) if you aren't dressed appropriately they take your ID card and scan it and send ....."</RelCText>

			<RelCText>I'm all for clamping down on inappropriate clothing in the shopping malls and in public; but I think there should be more leeway when it comes to the hotels. Also; they should have started implementing these rules a decade ago. They've let things go to far to have a hope in hell of policing it properly.</RelCText>

			<RelQSubject>Maternity clothes</RelQSubject>
			<RelQBody>Any advice on where to buy maternity clothes? So far; the few malls I've looked has either a terrible selection (i.e. a selection of 3 different items) or the prices are out of control. I'm to the point of buying online and paying to ship. Any ideas? (Please; serious comments only; I'm in no mood for sarcastic;silly; male humor this morning...)</RelQBody>

			<RelCText>hi Minoush; I think you probably tried these shops already; ie; mothercare;marks and spencer; BHS; Next. Yup selection is awful; and prices are ouch. Have you tried H&amp;M? They did have many trousers; price range was 160-250Qar. The other thing to do would be to invest in good pair of basic colour trousers and get your tops stitched.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Haven't tried Mothercare at CC. I hate going there but I may have to... M&amp;S does not have a Maternity section. I don't get this... every local has at least 5 kids; plus every expat seems to be pregnant. Where do they all shop for clothes?</RelCText>

			<RelCText>I tried H&amp;M and their selection was ok. The only problem were the pants had this new fangled design where the waist is supposed to sit below your waist and it felt like my pants were about to fall down. Just too hip and cool for me. I'm old and I need mom jeans! :-) I will try BHS. I'm used to Target and discount stores. The idea of paying $80-$100 for a pair of pants that I will wear for 6 months is impossible. Checked online; shipping from Motherhood Maternity from the States is $70 for a ton of clothes. I think I will just do that.... Thanks ladies!

			<RelCText>hi Minoush; you will have to go to Mothercare at CC; because apparently all maternity wear from other MC shops are to shift to MC of CC; if not already there. You need to visit the MC inside Debenhams. The locals wear the abbaya; so a loose gown inside ( the jalabiyas; more like the house maxis) is not visible to anybody. Among Asian clothes there are many loose tops in style right now; with lycra tights; so again no problems there. Getting T's is not an issue; as long as you are okay with it hugging you tight all day. The trouser style; is the low bump style right now; and it doesnt really fall off.H&amp;M had the high waist trousers. not sure about baby shop for Maternity clothes; else you may have to try the large clothes section; like Evans; if you are looking for comfy tops. Check Giordano as well; they dont have maternity; but they usually have these loose comfy linen trousers that you can tie under the bump.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>I agree - Pretty bad - even worse if you want to buy something for work. H+M are fine if you are looking for casual but that is it. BHS does not have a maternity section (I asked in the one in Landmark) and mothercare is very expensive - perhaps order over the internet?</RelCText>

			<RelCText>I've only been to one; but if you mean dull as dogshit when you say down and dirty; than I guess thats right. The parties are separated into two groups; men and women; and there is no alcohol (at least at the womens parties) they dance to loud disco music and dress scantily for other women while critizing what every other woman is wearing. Not exactly the greatest party of all time.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>"The men's part of the wedding is pretty straight forward. Invitees congratulate the groom and his father; brothers... You sit next to him for the traditional coffee and tea; have a picture taken with him. Later on there's a buffet and an ""'ardha"" which is a traditional sword dance. Very nice; beautifully decorated garments. After that groom goes to the women's party and joins the bride. At least these are my first-hand observations. There's no ""down and dirty"" part there."</RelCText>

			<RelQSubject>Saturday nights in Doha? Qube nightclub?</RelQSubject>
			<RelQBody>Hi all! Me and some friends from london are looking to come over to Doha for a couple of weeks. Whats the party scene like on Friday and Saturday nights? I hear that in Qatar nobody goes out on saturday; is that true? Where would you go for RnB and hiphop? And Ive heard alot about a club called Qube is it any good?

			<RelCText>If you enjoy filipino cover bands and lots of asian variety in the crowd then the Qube is GREAT; however if you enjoy more of the western flair you are down to Garvey's; Rugby Club; and Rydges. Of these your best bet for Fri and Sat night (my OPINION; so no flames from anyone) is going to be Rydges. The bar is under new Aussie management with the goal of MUCH better music and faster service. This past weekend was quite busy and the music was good enough to dance to. So there you hav it; one recommendation</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Is pretty good on a Thursday night. Nice crowd of people and a good British band. Not clubbing though.

			<RelCText>I agree with Tyler and bbksiu. Although the best way to enjoy your weekend in Doha is by get together with friends in one of our house; have dinner (bbq) and drinks (alcohol) you can buy alcohol if you have the license; play some games (e.g. Risk and Card) watch the latest dvd; you can put music on and DANCE (Becareful your neighbor!!!!) and if you too drunk to go home; your friend can get you a lift; or there always a taxi.

			<RelCText>"Amaru Immortal - Clubs (I mean night clubs) here in Qatar are no comparison to what you'd find in a non-muslim country. They both serve alcohol; have music (live/djs) but that's where the comparison ends. ""Where would you go for RnB and hiphop?"" Take a plane and go somewhere else. :-) I'd suggest Heat or Mercury Lounge in Melbourne for RnB/Hip Hop. ;-) (Bit of promotion from an ex-employee) If you still wanna come to the Middle East for clubbing; go to Beirut or Istanbul. Maybe even Cairo for that matter. Or go to Goa; India if you wanna spend Xmas at trance parties on the beaches. Or go pub hopping in Bangalore. ""I hear that in Qatar nobody goes out on saturday; is that true?"" True. We go out on Thursdays. That's the weekend here. Happy hour starts at 5:30pm."</RelCText>

Customer service tell me to enrol in some wafa points but both the website and contact number of wafa do not work if i wish to enrol. Awesome.

My boyfriend lives in Bahrain however and I visit him there every weekend. Bahrain is a lot more laid back; you can buy pork; get a glass of wine and a restaurant and access anything you want on the internet. It doesn't have all the oil money so the locals are a little more down to earth but it's more developed. Better restaurants and shopping malls. Most of all; you can get a penthouse apartment for 6000QAR.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Well I date a Saudi so I have to say he and his friends treat me very respectfully. Yes lot's of them do go to Bahrain on the weekends; but so do a lot of Qataris and Kuwatis. The place is basically crawling with people from the more conservative nations on the weekend. Besides the fact that the number of land cruisers increases and there are more people in the pubs I haven't noticed a difference. As for dress; I can dress less conservatively in Bahrain than here. There are more single women as well so I don't feel like I stand out so much. Bahrani girls don't wear the abaya as much as here and I haven't seen to many in hijab. I doubt she'll notice many stares at all. As for it becoming more conservative; well they are closing down all the bars in the 3 star hotels because that's where all the prosititutes hang out. But my guess is you won't even notice they are gone.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Thanks; how awesome; I was thinking it was more like 1.5 hours from what everyone has said about Doha traffic!! :) Being here in the USA is a bit difficult to find out what areas are best to live in Doha... My husband and I love being at home; we prefer high rises with a nice gym though given we are bringing motorcycles over I am thinking somthingh is a garage might be best. We have no kids so schools and having other kids around us is not a top priority. Given this; which areas/buildings would you guys recommend? We don't want to commute more than say 30-40 minutes each way if we can help it (to and from new DOHA airport). What information is there out there about the Pearl; I imagine is still is mostly a huge construction site but are there finished buildigns there worth commuting to and from? Are shoping areas and restaurants nearby already finished? Thanks so much! Kiki</RelCText>

			<RelCText>"Qatar's property development websites are misleading as most of Qatar itself. What you see is not what you'll get. Lusail is a ""planned new city"" due to open soon but you go there now; all you'll se is an empty desert land with maybe 2 tower cranes. Pearl is nearly completed but with a lot of infrastructure and other nature problems. Both locations are at the north outskirts limits of the city; while the new airport is being built at the southern outskirt limit of the city. You do have to across the whole city and the traffic here is another nightmare (not only the traffic jams but also the aggressive and risk driving local style). If no traffic; it will be a 20-30 minutes drive. The best location for you would be near by the Marriott Hotel. A friendly advice: be prepared for the biggest frustrations you ever experienced at professional and social levels and you won't be disappointed. I wish you all the best!"</RelCText>

			<RelCText>"Yes I'm from Florida and yes photography pays *some* of our bills ;) Husband got contract to work in Doha so I am thinking the expensive part of living arrangements there will all depend on what his contract stipulates. Thanks for the real estate agent contact mdobrasz; will see if we can start lining up some visits to different areas and take a look at villas vs condo... not sure what is best for us yet. I think given we are going to try to bring our 2 motorcycles a house with a garage will be best... Nic; thanks for the advice; I think we'll probably opt to be closet to airport than to drive 1 hour to get to and from work. So far I have seen very little ""real"" pictures of Doha; mostly plans and projection images of what it *will* look like so we figure we're in for huge construction site in the desert ;)"</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Hi; I am not actually in Doha yet myself; arriving at the end of this month. The only vehcile imports I have done in Doha previously was for the Oilfield Market; and is done slightly differently. You might be surprised; I seen a couple of big bike shops here in Doha when I visted a few weeks back. Anyhow; in Dubai a few years ago; I imported some choppers from the guys off Discovery Channel program. The Duty was 5% of the CIF Value. (eg. Bike is US $20000 CIF then Duty will be US $1000) I then had to pay a local agent commission on the import of US $1500 each as they held the import licence agreements for the bikes. Therafter; Police Inspection; Registration and other details were approx. $1200 per bike. Then of course you will have standard insurance and road tax; which I believe is approx. $100 per month in Doha. (Someone can correct me if I am wrong) PM me if you need further information; I do work in this field and can get a colleague to check all the ins and outs if required. Have.....</RelCText>

			<RelCText>My husband is a life-long motorcycle junkie. Got his first when he was about 10 years old. He would never consider riding one here in Doha. Traffic is very dangerous. They have the highest accident rate per capita in the entire world. Check out some you-tube videos showing all the spectacular car crashes in Doha. You have to see it to believe it. Seriously most people see a car crash every single day. Riding motorcycles on the streets in Doha is only for fools in my opinion.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>i use the htc diamond; i have had it for almost 6 months; if you are the kind who uses mobile for emails and internet alot;then this is not an option.. the wireless signal is never stable and keeps disconnecting; the phone freezes too much; especially after receiving a phone call. i reset my phone almost everyday since using it. The graphics are cool;i think they have the best compared to other phones; the resolution is another thing;its not as bright as the other phones;it would have made the graphics more cooler if it was more brighter...AND....the camera! if u r one who enjoys taking pics with mobile...this is not the one for you....</RelCText>

			<RelCText>i personally hate the blackberry; it is a pain in the arse to use. The iphone i pretty over rated in my opinion; yeah it's a tidy piece of kit got some cool things; but it is stupidly expensive here; IF i ever get one i will wait till Vodaphone release them (and they will). got to agree with shyampsunder on this one; go with HTC; they have being doing the touch systems for alot of brands of phone for a long time; and now they have their own phone; their features are great; and they are very easy to use. Wish i had one. I use a n95 been using it for over a year now; and it does everything i need it to. ____________________________</RelCText>

			<RelCText>lol apple; ur not a liar because u didn't define love; yeah it's that wonderful feeling but can u say what feeling it is ? u can't. I mean people spend years trying to write books about love and relationships but it's all nonsense because no relationship is like another; every relationship has its own dynamic and each love is unique so none of us can define love; we recognize it when we feel it but we can't define it because each one of us feels it differently.

			<RelCText>Dont listen to their nonsense. If you want to marry a Qatari girl; you will first of all need her families approval. After that - you may apply for an approval from higher authorities. The husband isn't; under any circumstance; going to get the Qatari passport if this is accepted and approved. The children will hold the father nationality - and they will not benefit any of the privileges that locals have. Good luck and let me know if you need more information.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>My salary 9820 with company accommodation mention in paper and contract. by Profession i have a an engineer visa also mention in labor contract and on id. There is a law in immigration if your salary is less than 10000 QR thousand then you should have company accommodation but if salary is above 10 thousand then either company accommodation of personal accommodation both are accepted. In immigration there is no law no rule they work on their mode. I am trying family visa since 2009 and it rejected every time with out any reason. In meeting you can't say anything just answer 3 question and meeting end.</RelCText>

			<RelQSubject>Question about wife's visa</RelQSubject>
			<RelQBody>I will be arriving in Doha on the 10th or 11th of December. My wife will be flying in approximately two weeks later and will be staying with me on my sponsorship for the duration of my contract. When she steps off of the plane in Doha; she will have her passport; but I don't know what else she needs in order to stay in the country with me. Can she get some sort of visitor visa or what? I am not sure what to do here. thanks everyone.</RelQBody>

			<RelCText>I am not too sure on all the formailities however; would suggest that you get in touch with your embassy. As far as I know; yor wife needs a RP (residence Permit) which can only be done once you have yours. If she come on the Visit visa; she will only be able to stay a few months and will have no rights (Hospital; Bank account finding a job etc). Not to say that she can not come on the Visit Visa but she would have to leave after the Visa expired and apply for a Residency under your name from her country unless she has her own sponslor in Qatar.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>You can sponsor your wife only when you have RP (residence permit) in hands. It will take approximately a month for you to get one; from the moment of entry and one more month to do the paperwork for your wife. My suggestion - ask your sponsor now; because they will have to help you with it.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Chbck; your wife can come on a company business visa for 3 months renewable 3X. Once you get your RP; you can transfer her sponsorship under you; coz the company will give her No Objection Cert.; She doesn't need to exit and go back to her country. Once you applied for her the business visa; you just need to obtain a supporting affidavit from your embassy that you will shoulder all her expenses during the period. Trust me I did it for my cousin; though her sponsor was transfered to her company; and she got residence now. Good luck!</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Ok great; so let me make sure I understand what you are all saying. 1. My visa is good enough to get her in when she gets off the plane with nothing more than her passport. 2. She can get any other kind of visas that she needs to get once she's in the country and they won't make her go home. 3. If I leave for Doha on December 9th and she leaves for Doha on December 18th; we will be able to spend Christmas together. I understand that I should probably talk to my sponsor about all this too. thanks a million yall</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Waiiiit! Number 2. You have to apply the visa first from here (Doha) then send the visa no. to her so; she can print out from the net www.moi.gov.qa ;if she needs a copy. Visa application is just within 2 days(it depends). She just need her passport in the airport here coz her visa details is already in the computer network system in Immigration Doha Airport. Yes sure; you can possibly spend Xmas together but u must apply soon as u reached Doha.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Grrrrrrr. Lol! Ya ammi; it's not a form its a website that links Immigration in Doha. Assuming that you're already in Doha; and you want to bring your wife here very very soon; fortunately; u dont have RP yet. There is still a way for her to come but under any company business visa or a tourist visa (but 28 days only...also 3x renewable from travel agency); then transfered to your sponsor once you got ur RP. And she don't need to go back to her country. For the supporting affidavit; I think the best way is to get from her sponsoring company coz u dont have RP yet that time; right?

Many Lebanese are getting the visa but sometimes it's taking like 3 months and some other times it is taking 9 months and if they are lucky it is taking them 2 weeks.

			<RelCText>Do you mean that they will see if it's an urgent case they will accept ; and if not they will not ? I am wondering is it so easy to meet the captain !! I think I'll wait for your visit first as I don't have any good reason to give for this visa ... just I miss parent... may be it's not enough :-( Thank you and good luck ... hope you'll get the visa</RelCText>

			<RelCText>You don't need to Exit Qatar at all; You Just Need an NOC from Your Sponsor; Rest leave it to the Company PRO. 2) If you need to apply for Family Visit Visa; you need to have NOC from your Company; Bank Statement ( For Me to Sponsor my Brother; Didn't Required Bank Statement ); Salary Certificate; But 1st you need to Obtain your RP. 3) Make Sure to Clarify with your Company if they are Giving you Family Status Visa or Not; and Minimum Salary to Sponsor your Wife and Kids on Visit Visa is 7000 QAR Basic; and to Apply for their Resident Permit Basic Salary should be 10;000 QAR. 4) For Pakistani's Visa is a Bit of a Problem; But not that much as The Company i work in Hire Pakistanis Every Second Day without any Hassle of Visa....</RelCText>

			<RelQSubject>Qatar Employment VIsas - Pakistan</RelQSubject>
			<RelQBody>Hi; Can any Pakistani National advise me if Pakistani officials don't allow to leave for Qatar prior to coming to Qatar with out clearing the medical in Pakistan. I have been told that it's a new requirement that any person with Qatar employment visa must clear some medical in Pakistan prior to coming to Qatar. Any one knows about this law or rule? Thank You</RelQBody>

			<RelCText>Once you are done w/ ur medical exam you can check w/ the medical commission at least after 3 working days. Just show your receipt number or passport copy at the male counter section and you'll get to know if its ready or not. For a medical employees it usually takes about 2 wks to have the results done due to other test (e.i. creatinine test) that has to be sent to HMC for investigations. In your case; you are only required to undergo blood test(HIV) &amp; Chest X-ray(PTB); so i think it wont take long that much. Dont you have mandoop/representative for your company? he is supposed to follow up all these things and you can always check w/ him. Good Luck!</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Am not sure about exchanging the licence but for the test first of all there is no parallel parking test You can go to RAYA driving school and go the police officer first with the form and all required documents and try to exchange your license if not he will sign the form for you to do the test directly. You should do this first because the school will till that you need to take 10 lessons course You will start at 5:30 with the theoretical (signs exam) they will ask not more than 5-6 signs if you answered with confidence and quickly. THE DRIVING SCHOOL HAVE A SMALL BOOKLET that has around 30 signs Then they will let you know if you pass if yes you go out to start the practical exam: 1) Is the hill test ; you have to stop in the middle (on the line painted in the street) then continue till the end of it; then reverse back to you starting point ; which means you have to reverse as L shape 2) Then you go to the parking test; you have to do it in one shot and make sure not to cross the li.....</RelCText>

			<RelCText>first of all you have to get your residence permit; afterwhich you can apply for a qatar driving license. if you already have a driving license from your country; take note that most of the western countries they will just convert it. no need for you to take up the test or go to a driving school. if your license is from asia; it depends; but most of the asian license you have to undergo a driving test (signal; L and pocket parking; road test) or the traffice department will suggest on your application form to go to a driving school for two weeks. hope this helps</RelCText>

			<RelCText>"Simply becoz i work for them... hee haw!!! No really; if you're going to DC; then you're better off taking the QR flight coz we fly there non-stop and the aircraft is the A340-600 which is a beauty to fly in; especially if you're flying the premium class... even if it is economy; the pitch in between the seats is so much better than EK. If you're flying to NY; then i think EK go there direct; coz we fly to Newark (EWR) viz Geneva; on the A330; which is also a good aircraft to fly in...

			<RelCText>I can't remember last when I flew with Emirates. Oh yes; it was to and fro Jo'burg last August. I lost 2 piece of out 3 baggages that I had checked in! Their staff in Doha were so crappy that they didn't know what to answer me. All they had to say was DXB is a very busy station and such things tend to happen. I was like yeah fine; but is that what you will keep saying to rest of 9 families standing here with me!!?? LOL Contrastingly; and I am being very true here; I haven't faced a single problem with Qatar Airways flights for as long as I could remember. Last I can remember having a problem on QR was perhaps with food or something 3 years back. One a much important note; I haven't had any luck with any EK crew yet; sadly! :( ----------------------------------------- 1200 QL Points!!! Yay!

			<RelCText>Hell yeh... i have seriously to ask the sales dept. for my cut on the promotions im doing on their behalf... hey sorry if you guys are jinxed with QR; but really the crew services etc is much better than EK; coz I know for a fact that the EK crew dun give a damn bout service; they will be like yeh will get you that when i'm here next and you're like waiting. Regd you Jakarta trip; i think we fly the A300 aircraft there and those aircraft's are being converted into freighters; coz they are kinda old. LHR-DOH...cancelled... why? I'm sure there was a reason for that and you would have been compensated (not that it is any consolation) And AMM trip... well delays were a part of the airport expansion during that time... So dun you think i deserve a good BONUS this year... (if they have heard of anything like that)...lol!!!

			<RelCText>i guess your flight with Emirates is jinxed in the contrary of mine lmao. I witnessed QA cancellation in London ... and it was in total chaos.

			<RelCText>Yeh I flew Joberg from Dubai like 2 years ago when we were starting there and i was upgraded to Businesss Class. But i can really tell you that QR Economy class service on these long haul flights was better than the EK J class service. Besides; they always mishandle baggage coz they have a minimum connecting time of i think 1.5 hours; so if your connecting anytime less than that; youu can rest assured; your baggage won't ride the flight you're in. So not the case with QR.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>The only plausible reason would be that those 4 guys were not QR staff but the Ground Handling staff and hence they must have been pointing to the QR staff.

			<RelCText>"Now thats what we call; ""Taking you more Personally""! LOL But yes; I kinda agree with Novita that QR flights are delayed on most occassions. Even the crew friends of mine laugh about it cos they can't really commit to what time their arrival back in Doha would be at; to catch up on a party / a movie or something. ----------------------------------------- 1200 QL Points!!!

			<RelCText>Small correction here; Eng &amp; Avid;) Your company can issue you an exit permit; but you will still be blocked by the Immigration at the airport during departure; when your name is blacklisted in the system. If you know that you had previous police case( ex. returned cheque); obtaining exit permit doesn't mean that your name is cleared from the system. You must follow up w/ the capital police after 6-months from the date you settled your case to remove the blacklisted of your name in the Immigration airport.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Apple I am not arguing with you. My PRO said when they apply for exit permit it will be directed to interior ministry for endorsement. If there is anything against you; your exit permit will be rejected by the system. it is computerised and we are applying for all our immigration requirements through on-line. To clear the black listing you need to go to public procrcutor's office (NIYAMA) and settle your penalties. (near city centre) and the public procecutors office can clear your record within short time if you aooroch them with your lawyer. This is what our lawyer said.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>You got good points; and neither i'm not arguing w/ you. I was giving you an example of a police case(ex. returned cheques). Coz this is the common case that can happen to anyone. If your case was filed at Capital Police; you need to clear your name from there. If it was a Court case then you should go to Niyaba. Mostly; the case are to be filed from the Police dept. then forwarded to the court for settlement depends on both the plaintiff &amp; the suspects agreement. Another example is if your bank filed a complaints against you to the capital police for not paying your debts(Car loan; Credit cards; Personal loans); then your name will be blacklist in the system till you settled your accounts. Accordingly; only after 6-months from the date of your settlement before your name is remove from the blacklist. What i'm trying to imply here is; if you know that you had previous but settled criminal or civil cases; nothing wrong to clear your name &amp; follow up at the place where the charges agains.....</RelCText>

			<RelCText>go to the sales center in the arrivals terminal &amp; talk to the sales staff there. almaha only takes bookings prior to 24 hours of the flights; how ever depending on the work load they have a chance of accepting your booking; yet you might have to pay a sum of Qr 300.00 extra to the normal service fee. i too agree with Khanan. she will be able to proceed her self if you are able of instructing her on how to. make sure you give her clear instructions. if she is a bit old; ask her to hire a porter for just Qr 20.00(porter counter is located to the left once you enter the baggage area. it will give you a porter ticket enabling her to hire a porter) which; the porter will locate the bag for her &amp; bring her to you. if you wish to you can tip the porter with another additional amount of your choice. i dont see any point of u wasting about 500-600qr when you can get the work done just in 20qr - 30qr. all the best &amp; wish your mom a pleasant stay in DOH!</RelCText>

			<RelCText>That's the thing Margaret; I've been offered a reasonable shipping allowance. It seems such a waste though (financially and moreover environmentally); to ship the basic practical stuff. I'm not particularly attached to 'things' in any event. My most favourite things are my friends and my memories. I can't ship my friends over in a tea-chest; although some may come to visit; and my memories are mostly in my head; although some are also recorded in photo form; and I wouldn't want to entrust my most dearly loved photos to a shipping company. I've never been particularly materialistic and so my favourite 'stuff' amounts to a few trinkets and things bought on my travels; shoes (but I'm going to limit myself as to how many pairs I bring over; because I want to -- and can -- travel light). I particularly like a lamp; a few pictures and paintings; my Le Creuset pans (although they are so stupidly heavy I wouldn't dream of shipping them half way across the world). I can live without those thoug.....</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Blankets. During the UK summer I find even the lightest duvet is too warm and I prefer to use a cotton waffle blanket. Friends who had lived in the middle east advised me that with the air-conditioning I would need a duvet here. They were wrong. We keep our air-co at 25 degrees and I miss my blanket. I can't find cotton waffle blankets here; only nasty fleece ones. The choice of duvet covers isn't too good either - too expensive or too tacky - especially since bhs went up in smoke. It got pretty cold in the winter. Bring an electric fire. Plastic food containers are generally of poor quality and you need to keep dry food sealed up or the bugs will get in.</RelCText>

And the length of time it takes to clear stuff is the other problem. Even if I did want to ship some practical household items; I would surely have bought some replacements by the time my own were shipped and cleared customs! @ Squarepeg: Blankets -- that's an interesting point; squarepeg; I mostly have duvets and throws at home; but I might get some blankets. Do the a/c units work as heaters too? I recall that when I lived overseas before; the a/c units also worked as heaters; do they have similar units in Doha?

			<RelCText>I didn't see many bugs; so I stored some dried food in plastic bags with the tops rolled over. I was in the UK for a couple of months in the summer and when came back I found weevils in the flour; rice etc. I threw it away and invested in some plastic containers with good seals. Haven't noticed any bugs in the kitchen since. To be honest; I've had more problems with ants in the UK than I've had with bugs here. Here; we have a bug man who comes and sprays around the house onece a month. There's an earlier thread on this subject somewhere in the archives; I think. I think I'm right in saying that a/c units here generally don't also work as heaters. Certainly in our house they just cool.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Well; I remember this happening around my place last year &amp; my dad had to literally go out and shout at them. U can just get the supervisor's contact number from those workers and speak to him regarding this. They are actually not permitted to work in residential areas at odd hours (23.00hrs - 5.00hrs). Just speak to him and tell him its not tolerable since u have school going kids at home and if it continues then u would complain to the higher authorities. Good Luck!!!</RelCText>

			<RelCText>The reason behind most non-muslims who have converted was only to marry a Muslim girl. They know that they cannot have her any other way; unless she sins; and not all do. Yes she should accept the man for who he is and for what he believes in; but us as Muslim females - we are restricted to standards and we cannot change them. Its too complicated to discuss; but good luck. Take more time to learn Islam and maybe the faith in Allah will grow in your heart - not for HER (the girl-friend) but for Allah himself.</RelCText>

LOL Dating sites all seem to be controlled by the same holding group; just the web addresses are different; the page layout; photographs etc are the same. Just by the accessing person's IP address they change the country in the advertisement; so as to attract a click. It all ends up the same ""Pay by Creditcard/Paypal/Money Transfer"". My hypothesis is that; there are actually two worlds while we males dwell in one; lots and lots of beautiful girls seem to be spending time in loneliness in some other world; somewhere out there. My plan is just to stay alive till the time the two worlds meet !!!"</RelCText>

Though the question may have been answered or you know the person who posted the thread; it is not acceptable to hijack any thread (unless it has been announced in the beginning as a hijack thread) The reason being that the question may be important to most readers and the essence of the topic is lost due to serious hijacking. Hijacking defeats the purpose of our mission of information dissemination. b. I know most of us (including me) still have the hang-over from our successful Christmas party; victory parties and Birthday parties. However; we should not use this ""high"" to hijack each and every thread opened from then. ""Hinay-hinay"" lang because most other readers/members cannot relate to them and sometimes personal jokes can be read as demeaning; immoral and indecent by others who cannot relate.

Do remember that all units of hamad hospital do not have a strict appointment system; you just go there early and take the token and wait for your turn.

			<RelCText>You need a valid health card (otherwise you'll have to pay more). Then you schedule an outpatient appointment at the counters (there in the HMC outpatient clinics) and they'll give you the date.

And after 1 day I checked my same application number on the MOI website; and I got approved. That's all. Let me know if you need more info. Thx.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Who asked you to go for an MRI; that doctor can give a referral for hamad hospital; requesting a MRI. Appointment can take upto a month. I don't think it's necessary for the phc dr to give a referral or that you need to check again with a dr at hamad. I had a referral once directly from A private clinic for an MRI. but rules change. You can check with the dr you are following up your problem with; ask him or her for a referral and then go to hamad hospital X-ray MRI unit and check about the appointment. They are usually helpful; and if they appear uncooperative; please complain since their customer service takes such things seriously; but I don't think you will get such a problem. Their staff is usually helpful; sometimes it can take more than 3 staff members to give you the right picture but they will try and help you and guide you.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>May Allah gives you good health. In order to get any service from HMC; you need a Health card. Alongwith the Health card; go with your private Doctor MRI referral to the Main HMC MRI section or Al-rumaila MRI section ang get the appointment. So simple. Best regards.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Secure a health card if you have not done so already by visiting the Health Center of your area with a pp size photograph and QR 100. (Of course you need to be an RP holder to be eligible) It might take a couple of days or even more to be with you. With that in hand visit your local health center again and see any GP with your complains; let him refer you to some specialist in Hamad related to your complain. Take an appointment of the specialist in Hamad. If luck is by your side and depending on the specialization you have been referred to; it might take somewhere between 1 to 6 months before you could see the specialist. Last time when I was there to take an appointment for evening clinic (not free even with health card); I was told that the appointment system itself is being upgraded and no appointment is possible until January next year. So watch out. Now if you are really lucky and you get to see the specialist and he feels that you need an MRI Scan done; he will issue you a paper .....</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Hi flexicode; you can see a doctor at hamad without going through the health centre. I have had two appointments with different doctors and one for my family member; by directly asking for an appointment.ofcourse you don't get the appt immediately; depending upon the doctor; some specialists are available within a week's time; while renowned consultants have a std waiting period of 45 days; miss that appt and the next one is after another 45 days.grrrr;downside of waiting to meet a consultant is that if he is on a casual leave on the day of the appointment; they don't inform you and some junior dr will see you; beats the point of actually taking an appt with a consultant and then waiting to see him. It helps if you have a referral and a referral by a private dr should be fine too. Most important is to have a health card;once you have applied; they issue you a receipt; you can use the hospital services with the receipt.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>I must add that they keep changing their rules so one month you can get an appt over the phone and the next month they would ask you to go to the phc first for a different appt. Moreover getting an MRI done outside could cost almost 1500 or more;depending upon the area being scanned. But it depends on how worried you are about your condition; and the cost is nothing; you get your results quickly; but if you can wait; its better to get into the national health care system; its not costly; and let them take care of you. Hope you feel well soon.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Firstly thank you all for the quick and informative responses. Nobody has actually ASKED me to get an MRI; but I want to do it myself as I am worried about my back. My lower back has been aching me for about 2 weeks now; and yesterday the upper right side of my back starting hurting. I visited a Doctor and he instantly told me that it is NOT a slipped disc; and is just a muscle spasm as the pain doesn't extend to my legs; though I still want to be certain as I want to start working out again; but I don't want to mess with my back if I shouldn't. And he said the upper back pain was also normal; and not related to a slipped disc whatsoever. Thanks again!</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Hello; sad to hear about your back pain. Your dr is right; if your pain is not extending to your limbs and are not feeling any pain or numbness in your fingers or toes; feet; then you don't need to worry. It's possible that you have injured yourself during your workout or is due to your work position; the way you sit at your desk; the way you sit while driving etc. Slip disc would give you excruciating pain; even simple tasks can become difficult; I am not sure if slip disc is the same as disc bulge; but in a disc bulge; if it starts touching the nerve; then you can have crazy tingling pain. You can try asking for an appointment with a dr.arun at hamad hospital in the evening clinic; or try to meet him at alkhor hospital. He is available in Doha only on Tuesday the other days; he is in alkhor.waiting time can be long; because he quite sought after. You can also meet dr.bhat at Doha clinic; he is one of the best and a longtimer in Doha. I would advice you to refrain from weight training.....</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Hey han19; Thank you so much for the reply; and the advice. I feel so much better knowing that it hopefully most likely is NOT a slipped disc. Being so young; and having started a new career; it would really not be a good thing. I have stopped weight training completely for now which sucks; but do you think it would be a good idea to introduce it very mildly? You think jogging is okay? I want to meet a proper Doctor; even if at a private hospital; as the guy at Hamad was busy; and only barely gave me any advice. I am sure a proper doctor can give me advice as to how exactly the right position is to sleep; to sit; etc. Maybe can give me some exercises to do to help me recover faster. You know any Doctor; even at a private hospital you specifically would recommend? These problems are to do with the Radiology section is that right? Forgive me as I know VERY little about hospitals and such problems; as I have had very few problems in the past (touch wood). Thank you again</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Hi Hmd; I would not advice you to do any strength training till you back pain subsides. Are you a heavy person. Brisk walking is preferred to jogging as in jogging you are putting a lot of impact on your lower back; as well as our knees. If you are a heavy person then you shuld try to avoid jogging n skipping.brisk walk is great again body posture is important. The stomach muscles support the back; so you need to firm up our stomach. A good physiotherapist can suggest some basic exercises; especially for the back and they really help. They are very simple; if you are into exercises u should know the cobra posture; cat stretch; simple leg lifts while lying down. For sitting position try to google office ergonomics and they usually have a standard picture that shows how one should be seated at an office desk. Wile driving; if you drive long distance; you need to move your neck frequently. You may call Doha Clinic hospital; and ask for Dr. Bhat; he is very good and his treatment is usuall.....</RelCText>

			<RelCText>do not use kerosene or oil heaters in your home. carbon monoxide is the number one winter killer. Also if you use any space heater keep all drapes and linens a minimum of 3 feet away on all sides. never plug a space heater into a power strip; only directly into the wll to prevent high current draw from melting insulation and starting a fire; These things are dangerous even with proper precautions so at least read the warnings and heed them.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Good info tyler the first thing that came to mind for me was to plug the heater directly into the wall because the extension cords/plugs cannot handle the power and will burn out or cause a fire!! Tyler which ones are the kerosene/oil heaters?? we have these electric heaters which look like the european water/steam heaters but i dont know whats inside them?</RelCText>

			<RelCText>I do not know what styles are available; however the stand alone ones that look like old radiators are sealed steam heaters and you can also buy the small electric heaters in which you can physically see the coils and they blow air via a fan across the coils. Personally you should just have a warm body to curl up with. If it is too cold for one get a second and snuggle up. Skin on skin is the best way to stay warm and transfer body heat. A 3 dog night is darn cold but on that same evening a one woman night may cause perspiration.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Just buy a new replacement plug and repair the existing cord. Next step is to make sure the outlet is installed properly and then verify the rating on the breaker. Don't trust the wiring in the house until you pull the wall plate and check the wire size and termination. Not the best electrical work is being done in the new construction; always verify.

			<RelCText>Once you are done w/ ur medical exam you can check w/ the medical commission at least after 3 working days. Just show your receipt number or passport copy at the male counter section and you'll get to know if its ready or not. For a medical employees it usually takes about 2 wks to have the results done due to other test (e.i. creatinine test) that has to be sent to HMC for investigations. In your case; you are only required to undergo blood test(HIV) &amp; Chest X-ray(PTB); so i think it wont take long that much. Dont you have mandoop/representative for your company? he is supposed to follow up all these things and you can always check w/ him. Good Luck!</RelCText>

			<RelCText>You are exactly in the same situation where my wife was. She is doctorate and was teaching in college. After my daughter born; she resigned. When my daughter reached to 4 years of age; she took the job in the same school where my daughter got admission. She worked for almost free just to be with my daugher all the time. Her sacrifices paid and now my daughter works for Microsoft USA. Any way; very nice to know about your outstanding education and achievments Do not bother for the salary.

			<RelCText>Ice Maiden; That's so similar to my story. Its been a year for me as a stay home mommy and this will be same for next 6 months and then we will leave Qatar so that I can continue working. I stayed home for all this time here just so that we could stay together as a family while hubby completes his assignments here. Have questioned my decision myself quite a lot of time but I am happy and so is my family. So that's all that matters in the end :-) Sorry for the little hijack.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Sorry; but 3 of my friends really doesn't like and had bad experience with koala. Two of them are parents and feel something not true and saw incoherence. One of them worked there and told us the worst things we could hear. What better we can know from a worker; a person who can see more than parents ! Actually; she told me lot of exemple that what they show to the parents is completely different than what's really happen there. So for that I really do not recommend this nursery !</RelCText>

			<RelCText>ASD does not start until 4 years old; DESS is having interviews for places now; but it is very hard to get a place with a sibling or British passport (and even then; rather hard).

			<RelCText>If you are planning to go back to America; then ASD is your best option; because; as far as I know; it is the only school that follows a US curriculum. Their website is very informative. ASD is where most American children go to school; including embassy-related children. They do not start until pre-k (four years old); so looking for a good preschool is probably your best option and then enrolling your child in ASD for the following. Space is limited for Pre-K; and so my understanding is that applying on the first day possible is important--this is usually a day in the autumn; but the website can help. In terms of good preschools; there are several; and where you live will make a difference. There are MANY threads on this side with parents discussing the merits of each. I have heard very good things about Appletree and Starfish. Joining Doha Moms is a good resource too; even if just until you settled.

			<RelCText>There are several good nursery schools with English as the primary language around Doha. My son when he was preschool age attended Mulberry Bush and then Doha English Speaking Kindergarten. A good friend of mine owned and ran these places but I don't think she still has Mulberry Bush.

It's been a few years so I don't know about any of the teachers; etc that might still be there; or if my friend Louise Al Jaidah still owns the place; but you can call and find out.

			<RelCText>a decent Nursery over here that keeps your kid until 3pm. It is not like England over here. Avoid in house food too. Too many 'support staff' from third world countries that don't wash their hands. Only go with British run ones and then I would check out the number of 'cheap labor' staff they had. Look at is this way; if you were paying a lot of money for a supposed decent Nursery; you would expect the staff to be trained. Over here we don't have that. Most of them have 'degrees' from a Mickey Mouse University. They say they have degrees in Nursing; Education and Admin. Most can't speak English. Really do your research; it is crap over here with the number of third world people who say they have degrees and then don't even know what they are supposed to be talking about. They are desperate for jobs and will lie to get one. They don't care at all that your kid’s education may be hindered by them lying. Just be careful.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>If you want anything close to a garden you will have to most likely get on an older compound or a stand-alone. You can still get nice villas on older compounds but they don't seem to be building large gardens with new compounds...very tight.

			<RelCText>Well thanks for all your replies - you are a helpful lot I can see this forum is going to be a lifeline to me! I am most concerned about garden rather than location and I think judging by what I have found out so far location is very important on how much villas cost. My husband has been out for a trip already and says that there are really no horrible places to live in Doha at al! An older or stand alone villa sounds like the bext chance of having a garden attached. I will have a look at all the recommended websites this evening - many thanks again for all your replies</RelCText>

			<RelCText>30QR per hour seems to be the standard charge for private arrangements for house cleaning here in Doha plus you might have to pay a transportation charge too depending where she/he is coming from - hopefully you will find someone local in Al Khor! Most cleaners here are either Philipino's; Sri Lankans or Indonesians. I have a Philli lady and she is very thorough. Speaking English reasonably well also helps! Why would you want someone 6 hrs a day 3 times a wk? Unless you also want someone for child minding. My cleaning lady does top and bottom of our 3 bed villa in 3 hours and does a good job. She comes twice a week mostly to get rid of the dust that continually seeps in from all cracks n crevices! LOL We do outsource ironing though and I do our washing! If you can find a good laundry service in Al Khor it should be quite cheap and satisfactory! Ours pick up and deliver too. Good luck in your search and hope this helps!</RelCText>

At the moment i am commuting in the traffic daily from Muntaza traffic light to the school. Got alot of girlfriend who looking around for a house. Everytime they call for the agent they will asked where your hubby working for? Bachtel; Maersk; Halliburton or something like that. Then they know how much your allowance would be.

			<RelCText>Hi All. I used Mr. Kabeer for my recent move within Doha. His price was very reasonable; a third of the price of the major moving companies. They packed everything up for me. I had to organise my own boxes which I did from QMart at the Mall; and they put all my stuff into them for me. They were quite careful with my stuff and no serious damage was incurred; but I had to supervise that they packed the fragile items carefully; and instruct them on what to put in each box. I strongly recommend him; but as with any move; supervise that the valuables and fragiles items are packed carefully or even better; by yourself. Also; be on hand to manage the packing.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Wow; that is alot of money. Depending on where you stay as cost of renting an apartment varies on location and type. IF you get a room; sometimes it costs 2000~4000 for villa around old airport area. Those slightly better conditioned apartment flat like 2 bedroom ones maybe around 7500~13000 like holidayvilla service apartment. Water and Electric bill probably around 300 or less. Phone bill local is cheap+internet if you get a package maybe less than 500 per month (this includes the special TV package) If you can secure an accomodation like now in some hotel cum apartments you might get a good deal for a period of a year rental as this is when less people visit Qatar. Next is your transport. Assume you rent a car (think about buying later on); on average a decent car probably cost from 1600 to 2000. Fuel cost probably is around less than 200 per month if it is general travel within Doha to and from work with occassional travel in the weekend.

			<RelCText>should be making more than 20;500 per month. But that salary is certainly enough to live well on and to save quite a bit on (assuming you won't have a lot of other expenses). Benefits? No taxes! free furnished housing (probably doesn't include utilities -- check on this) free LOCAL medical (note that this is ONLY for local govt. clinics and Hamad Hospital; not the better private clinics in town where folks speak English; and it will NOT cover you when you return to your home country of origin in the summer -- be warned! It should also include free schooling for any kids you have (you don't say if you have any) -- and again; tuition here varies widely; so you need to know their cap on the dollar/riyal amount because I am SURE they would never pay to send your kids to the American School or something that cost more than; say; QR 25;000/year. Here's where some extra expenses might figure into the mix... So; not bad; but that salary is rather low for a PhD.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>You can get an apartment for around 6;000 Riyals (2-bedroom) in a reasonably good area; a car can be hired for 1;800 to 2;000 Riyals a month (or buy one as you won't have a problem to get finance for buying) and the rest is up to you; how much you spend on food. You can go to 5 star restaurants and pay 300 Riyals for a meal or go to the shwarma shops and other more simple restaurants and pay less than 30 Riyals.

Depends really on how you are going to live here: Villa living is between 10 -14 000QR/month for something nice; and apartment living is between 6500 -8500QR/month for a 2-3 bedroom.

			<RelCText>It depends on your living standard and expectation for savings. In this connection it is important to know do all allowances (specialy accomodation allowance) are included or not in this amount. For example rent of a villa will be in the range of 12;000 - 20;000 QR etc. Good Luck</RelCText>

			<RelCText>it depends if it is excluding the accomodation or including because if you want to live in a villa you need something like 10000 QR monthly and if it it is included then you will end up with 20000 which is enough to live a meduam life for you and your family To be honst i think it is a good salary for an engineer or maybe senior person so go a head and good luck</RelCText>

			<RelCText>I remember my Eid childhood. It was great. We'd first meet up at my grandfather's home. We'd all talk and the children would plan 3ayuding. We'd all go from house to house; sing a song and look cute and be given 1 riyal. After going door to door; we'd go back home and play until it was time to eat the large feast. Parents would usually chat. Families get together. People visit and they have some tea and snacks. We pray.

			<RelCText>Oh Oryx; you are so right! Ramadan should be a month of less (material things) and more (spirituality). For a lot it is. Our schedules do not change much (eg. we do not eat all night which negates the point of fasting in my opinion). We break our fast at sunset with a small light meal. Then we have dinner in the evening. We get up before dawn for a small breakfast. We try to be better Muslims in this month...in the hope we can carry this on throughout the year. I do see Qatar changing from when I was a child during Ramadan. This is something to do with us; of course; and also the influx of expats. _______________________________________________________ Love is the answer...</RelCText>

			<RelCText>We tend to do a bit of baking prior to Eid. Usually the night before (or earlier if you're really organised) we gather the kids around and make some biscuits and traditional sweets. These are then ready to distribute during the Eid prayer and also to the neighbours. They are also really handy when people come to visit you during Eid. What I've noticed here in Qatar is that friends and neighbours seem to visit each other a lot more on Eid than back home. I guess it's because we don't have family here; so our friends tend to become our new support structure. On the 2 Eids that I've so far spent in Qatar our 'new' tradition seems to be going to City Centre and getting some good sale items! LOL I guess that's our variation on spending the day at the park (too hot) or visiting the grandparents (too far) or staying at home (too boring).</RelCText>

			<RelCText>"... but locals are obliged to wear it. I was told at work that they even get an allowance to wear the costume (not sure from the company or the state). They are not supposed to wear anything else while in Qatar. It is sort displaying that you belong to a certain race when you're in a minority situation; and i'm not going into the VIP territory again. As for western women wearing it; as long as you're not walking ""alone""; it should be OK. At the least you should be walking with another woman; preferably wearing the same. If you two get into a Landcruiser at the end of your walk; that's even better :) Moudir"</RelCText>

			<RelCText>without government approval of your marriage; you won't get a family visa back into Qatar; unfortunately. Marrying you out of the country can cause major problems for your fiance; so I would suggest you wait until your marriage is approved. The only other option is that you relocate somewhere else; marry there; but your marriage will not be valid in Qatar; and you will have no claim to any inheritences if god forbid; something should happen to him. Does your fiance not have some Wasta; that can obtain your release from your company? I am not saying that will make things any easier; since you still need to have the govt approval for marriage; but at least you can be in Qatar; near him.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>The best companies in Qatar are the international companies such as Shell; ExxonMobil; Occidental; Maersk and some others. The problem with the local companies is that they can fire you anytime whereas the international companies tend to keep people as they have trained them from scratch so laying them off is not an option. Moreover in the Q-Companies you will not be learning anything and just sitting idle. I definitely agree with Imz in this regard</RelCText>

Shell; Exxon Mobil;Oil co. obv are the best to work for but in case you dint get them you could also think abt co. like Schlumberger; BakerHughes; Weatherford; etc i.e. Oil service co. these are the co. you'd b proud to work for. Dont forget ppl from these co. are hired by QP's RASGAS and all; and I personally believe b'coz of these ppl only the QP and RASgas sort of companies are alive; otherwise they no more than any local shit co. here.</RelCText>

It is definitely illegal not only to import alcohol but also consume alcohol in any public place and also be drunk in public.

Had just bought a bottle of champagne ready to see in the New Year when the police arrived. He had to leave it there so was a bit pissed off!! The DJ was telling people to leave; that it was not a joke. Maybe your friend was drinking at one of the houses/apartments on Garvey's compound?</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Tsardoz - Talking about flavoursome beers; you can buy Franziskaner wheat beer here. Nowehere as good as Schoffer Hoffer but a good compromise considering you're in an almost dry nation. So if you're a SH fan like me; drink your fill before you come over. I remember that terrible desperation when Dan Murphy's stopped stocking this beer in Melbourne. After a brief search I found it at Vintage Liquors (Coles). You can get your share of euro lagers as mentioned by previous posters. As a true blue Aussie; I'm sure you'd understand if I said I can piss better than a Bud and won't touch Fosters with a stick. VB; Guinness and Kilkenny can be found here too. Sadly no XXXX or Carlton Cold. If you're feeling adventurous or want to slum it; try Kingfisher Strong. As an Indian I'd also recommend the regular Kingfisher (American style macro lager). Not similar to the one that can be purchased in Oz. That's made in New Zealand under license.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Now now...let's not hound Qatari-femme for her comments. Statistics apart; obesity is a serious problem; be it the US ; Qatar; India or elsewhere. Gone are the days when children would beg parents to let them go outdoors and play with friends. All that kids want to do these days are update Facebook pics; play console game and order in fast food. The first step is self-awareness. As Gadarene correctly mentions; accepting that there is a problem is very important. No amount of research; pills; diet programs and goading is going to help unless a person or family sits down and takes serious note of his/her/their current health condition. Simple solutions can make a very big difference: 1. Cook healthy food at home don't order in; 2. use healthy cooking medium like canola and sunflower oil; 3. reduce/cut intake of artery clogging food such as margarine; fatty cuts of meat; deep fried food; fizzy drinks; junk fast food; 4. eat appropriate quantities at fixed intervals; 5. encourage and parti.....</RelCText>

			<RelCText>My parents started giving us beer when we were about 14. We had whiskey when were about the same age; but for a teenager it isn't really that nice. In summer it was gin and tonics; and wine too. We didn't have vodka in the house; but it's good for teens because you can mix it with juices and soft drinks. In my opinion consuming the infrequent alcoholic beverage is a much better option than giving your kids soft drinks; chips; chocolate; sweet snacks; candy and burgers on a daily basis. Obesity and its related illnesses pose a much bigger threat to public health than alcohol abuse.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Ayurveda has guidelines about dietary habits...like: # In the evening avoid heavy foods such as meat; fish; yoghurt; cheese; buttermilk and fromage frais. # Avoid eating between meals. Instead drink hot water; or if necessary eat ripe sweet fruit. # Avoid reheated or stale food. # Most of one's food should be cooked; as the body can more easily absorb cooked food. Raw food should be eaten only as a side dish (e. g. salad). # Make use of culinary spices. They not only make the food tasty; but support the digestive processes as well. # Include all 6 tastes in each meal: sweet; sour; salty; pungent; bitter; and astringent. The tastes also have their own influence on the subtle inner balance of the physiology. # During meals you may sip liquids such as water; juice or lassi. Do not drink a lot and avoid ice-cold drinks - they dampen down the digestive processes. # Milk should not be drunk with the main meal. It can be taken alone or with a light meal of sweet tasting foods (e.g. toast; cer.....</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Carbohydrate rich food is not combined with acidic food items. eg if you take bread and lemon juice together; it will cause the digestive system to erratically digest both the items. Don't eat grain; cereal or pulses item with acidic items like citrus fruits; grapes; pineapple etc. Protein rich food items go well with low-carb food items like rice and vegetable. Vegetables also go well with all types of starchy; carbohydrate rich food items. Fruits should ideally be taken as a separate meal; independent of other regular meals. Milk and meat is bad combination. Never take milk and meat in a single meal. Separate intake of milk and meat by at least four hours. Milk and meat is good for body in several ways. When taken together; it becomes toxic. Many modern food styles fly on the face of this Ayurvedic food combination rule. Milk is also to be taken warm. Cold milk can cause indigestion. Taking milk too hot also is not desirable. Ending the meals with sweet dessert is not allowed in Ayur.....</RelCText>

			<RelQBody>Any advice on where to buy maternity clothes? So far; the few malls I've looked has either a terrible selection (i.e. a selection of 3 different items) or the prices are out of control.

			<RelCText>hi Minoush; I think you probably tried these shops already; ie; mothercare;marks and spencer; BHS; Next. Yup selection is awful; and prices are ouch. Have you tried H&amp;M? They did have many trousers; price range was 160-250Qar. The other thing to do would be to invest in good pair of basic colour trousers and get your tops stitched.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Haven't tried Mothercare at CC. I hate going there but I may have to... M&amp;S does not have a Maternity section. I don't get this... every local has at least 5 kids; plus every expat seems to be pregnant. Where do they all shop for clothes?</RelCText>

			<RelCText>I tried H&amp;M and their selection was ok. The only problem were the pants had this new fangled design where the waist is supposed to sit below your waist and it felt like my pants were about to fall down. Just too hip and cool for me. I'm old and I need mom jeans! :-) I will try BHS. I'm used to Target and discount stores. The idea of paying $80-$100 for a pair of pants that I will wear for 6 months is impossible. Checked online; shipping from Motherhood Maternity from the States is $70 for a ton of clothes. I think I will just do that.... Thanks ladies!

			<RelCText>hi Minoush; you will have to go to Mothercare at CC; because apparently all maternity wear from other MC shops are to shift to MC of CC; if not already there. You need to visit the MC inside Debenhams. The locals wear the abbaya; so a loose gown inside ( the jalabiyas; more like the house maxis) is not visible to anybody. Among Asian clothes there are many loose tops in style right now; with lycra tights; so again no problems there. Getting T's is not an issue; as long as you are okay with it hugging you tight all day. The trouser style; is the low bump style right now; and it doesnt really fall off.H&amp;M had the high waist trousers. not sure about baby shop for Maternity clothes; else you may have to try the large clothes section; like Evans; if you are looking for comfy tops. Check Giordano as well; they dont have maternity; but they usually have these loose comfy linen trousers that you can tie under the bump.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>I agree - Pretty bad - even worse if you want to buy something for work. H+M are fine if you are looking for casual but that is it. BHS does not have a maternity section (I asked in the one in Landmark) and mothercare is very expensive - perhaps order over the internet?</RelCText>

			<RelCText>I went for the first time to Ezdan today and what a complete and utter piece of trash it is. The finishings in Tower 3 were atrocious. How could the builder let this happen? The building is relatively new and already broken tiles; filthy cielings and walls. The wall tiles are still filthy from the worthless masoners who installed them. Typical old Doha masonry. Paint around the light switches; paint on the trim; careless finishing throughout. PLASTIC MOLD DOORS?!?! How cheap can they be??

			<RelCText>that's true. Finishing sucks; as elsewhere in Qatar. Furniture is not brand new; but at least comfortable and clean. Lighting is dull in the appartments... Kitchen is too tiny...Windows are small and dirty; but now they started to clean them. To cover all these negative points they provide the best gym and swimming pool in Doha; free of charge for tenants. Free cabel and Internet; free shuttle bus from your Tower to City Center; so you don't have to spend hours trying to find parking there. Housekeeping 2 times per week; full maintenance service. Small cafe in the Towers - you can enjoy a fresh coffee in the mornings; the sea food restaurant...Small play area for kids with slides and swings. All this is very helpful for the family with kids - especially housekeeping:)! Pesonnel is friendly and professional.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>I've been at Ezdan since mid August. Im in Tower 4 however... I've heard some crap about 1 and 2 but 4 is cool. The only pain I've had is that they insist on doing one of the 2 cleanings per week on a friday morning. I mean.. really.... most people are trying to sleep.... I would think it would make sense to do it during the week. I have a 1 bedroom (livingroom; kitchen; bedroom and 2 bath) on a 2 month contract.

			<RelCText>without government approval of your marriage; you won't get a family visa back into Qatar; unfortunately. Marrying you out of the country can cause major problems for your fiance; so I would suggest you wait until your marriage is approved. The only other option is that you relocate somewhere else; marry there; but your marriage will not be valid in Qatar; and you will have no claim to any inheritences if god forbid; something should happen to him. Does your fiance not have some Wasta; that can obtain your release from your company? I am not saying that will make things any easier; since you still need to have the govt approval for marriage; but at least you can be in Qatar; near him.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Thanks aaid. I plan to go to Salam one evening so I'll let you know what I find if I go before you. From reading up online I'm veering towards the IXUS 860 because of its wide angle lens. 8mp is more than enough for my needs so I don't think it's worth paying the extra for the 12mp 960 which doesn't have the wide angle lens (they seem to be the only differences) thatguy - Thanks. I do plan to buy online but I wanted to try out the various models before I ordered. Carrefour only have a couple of Canon compact cameras; none of them IXUS (and they appeared to have stop stocking Canon SLRs and lenses for some reason); and the Kodak shops have a very poor selection of manufacturers. -------------------------------------------- http://tall-and-ginger.blogspot.com</RelCText>

			<RelCText>It is really complicated..Palestine is probably the most prominent indicator of how unjust the world is being lead by politics and power. To your point; I would say it is due to the evolution of the political scene and the behaviour of the Zionist regime which pushed it into isolation to the point where they could not get adequate votes among UN member states. Additionally; west is a bit tired of supporting the Zionist's states and cleaning up its miss so they want to have some stability..The west was a key player in creating the Zionist state but they did not have the same intention Zionist's had..My thought anyway..interesting topic :)</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Why nearly all countries agreed was quite simple. Most believe in a homeland for the Palestinian people but not all can agree on what that should actually be. So making Palestine an observe state is a statement of intent without backing a full independence. Israel while continuing to build settlements in the West Bank is undermining the whole process and it seems obvious they want to swallow all Palestinian terrority. Shame on them.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>and rationality. Yes it should have been done much earlier; however what has happened has happened; and it's best to look at it from a better now than later; and better late than never angle.

			<RelCText>I think the world is becoming rather weary of this; apparently; irresolvable problem. This latest move is mostly symbolic; but very important and the environment of the region has changed; post Arab Spring. The global community wants a peaceful resolution and this should be two States; according to the 1967 agreement. Lets be clear; Israel is not full of Zionists (but they still seem to hold the power) and the Palestinians need to address the problem of Hamas for this to move forwards. I am optimistic about the move....</RelCText>

			<RelCText>for some crying is not abt weakness or wanting the other person to say sorry or give in to the situation but instead for me when i do cry/shed my tears is because i am so angry/upset that i want to say things that i am sure is gonna hurt the other person (saying out of anger) but i am trying so hard to control it as once it comes out there is no way of taking it back so to speak. so i am controlling it so hard that instead tears come flowing down; most ppl in an angry state will say things (hurtful things) in the moment of anger and when all has subsided realize that and its too late as it is already said and done with and hence hurts the other person........ my mom once told me the tooth paste story- only take the amt that you need if you were to squeeze too much of out the tube ya cant put it back in =-same goes for things said when in the heat of the moment (does more hurt than good)   life's too short so make the most of it; you only live but once.......</RelCText>

Thats a legal and humanitarian way to lead a successfull and prosperous life in this world and the hereafter.

			<RelCText>Winnie Park House has currently closed its waiting list for all years. I have two children at PHES and so far have been pleased. One is in year 10 and hates the uniform; the school the teachers..... I think he is settling in nicely. We had to wait until last week (end of Sept) to get a place for my daughter in reception year. But the facilities in the primary section are good. The class rooms are bright airey clean and inviting. They have canopyed areas for the children to play outside. The school is small (about 600 including secondary); but they are currently building further extensions for sixth form. They moved into these premises over a year ago. All the teachers I have met are enthusiastic and bubbly. The head teacher Mrs Brennan is very approachable and ameniable. They have a very pragmatic approach to education and have adopted the British healthy schools policy. There is no canteen so its invent as many ways as possible to make a sandwiche look interesting for the next 10 year.....</RelCText>

			<RelCText>I was just this morning talking to a colleague who has two kids at Park House as I am considering sending my own daughter there. The feedback is very positive. Good facilities (they have now got their new place and are no longer using the Russian Embassy building). Apparently the teachers are very kind but also exert a strong sense of discipline and manners (cell phones are not allowed). They have recently started offering the International Baccalaureate. Everything I have heard about Park House has been very positive.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Thanks very much you have really put my mind at ease. I currently work for Education here in the UK - it appears your approach to Qatar is much the same as mine - giving up the housework etc... and as for getting trim again I am also going to enrol in some slow toning classes! Did you find it easy to make friends in Doha. My husband has been there a week and could not even get to the beach on Friday as it was members only. Any suggestions for a place he can relax on his day off? He is waiting for us to get there to join clubs etc... Appreciate your help.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>My husband came over by himself and he found the first week awful. He nearly came home several times. If your husband likes a drink he could try Garveys or the Rugby club. Alot of british use these. I believe you have to join as a member or come with someone as a guest. Tell him to buy a copy of the Marhaba in Carrefours supermarket in City Centre. that lists all events happening in Q and where to go. It is updated every season. It is also available at Jarirs bookstore. What co. does your husband work for?</RelCText>

			<RelCText>I have emailed you directly as I am sure there is more knowledge you can share with me. Do you live in a villa or apartment. Our company has provided us with a new 3 bed apartment and I do not know what it will be like with a 7yr old; he is used to playing out on his bike etc... I suppose as I will not be working I will have to keep him occupied - any good places for children to play/met etc.. We already have a copy of Marhaba which has been useful. I think Ramadan is the biggest problem at the moment. My husband has a company vehicle but I think I will have to get a car to do the school runs etc.. do you think I could hire one initially? or lease? Who does your husband work for. My husband is working very long hours at the moment as they are so busy - keeps him out of mischief I suppose!</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Hi guys I couldt help myself but this topic has caught my attention; reason being is that we have an appointment with PHES school this week to enrol my two sons; im guessing one will be year 6 and the other year 8; from what ive heard about the school it has a really good reputaion and just been new to doha now 3 weeks werve been told that there are now spaces available; we did try doha but no luck there not until next year; so it will be interesting to see what happens; didnt realise getting your kids into a school in qatar would be more difficult than getting a job anywhwere in the country.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Would openly list countries where homosexuality is outlawed to be a vagabond nations. The matter of homosexuality is by far a much disputed affair among people of various religions; creeds and races; that to simply state it's right and all those who condemn it for any reason is wrong; will not be as simple. That said if they wish to protect those who are gay and transgenders from oppression and mistreatment then I suppose they have all the liberty to do so; however yes they should also then open their eyes to all the oppression committed around the world at large;and work towards stamping them out; and not just pick and choose to their convenience which has clearly been the case with UN in the recent times; which has caused people around the globe to hold them in contempt for; and not take them seriously.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>I agree with e46...park the car immediately. There can be several causes. If overheating; you will have a more whitish smoke mixed with steam. Do not just put water in the reservoir...you will need to use anti-freeze; but you will also need to have your thermostat checked out. If its greyish/blackish smoke; you're burning oil and you most likely have a broken head gasket or valve...both of these conditions are indicative of the worst case scenario. Also; don't forget to check your tire pressure every time you refuel.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>In case of black smoke; park your car; get out of the car n away frm it... and if its steamy kinda smoke; DO NOT do as novita sez... cuz if u open the radiator cap while its hot; u'll get a geyser kinda splash of hot water in your face n get burnt...</RelCText>

We believe that collectively our members have more knowledge about life in Qatar than any one person or guidebook. We want to provide a platform for them to share their knowledge and experiences and help newcomers adapt easily to life in Qatar."" Nobody shares knowledge or experiences or tries to help others in a chat room; it will just become a place for guys trying to pick up girls. There will not be any participation from all the members on any issue; people will be too busy chatting in private. That's what I personally think anyway.

			<RelCText>Sometimes people come into your life and you know right away that they were meant to be there.to serve some sort of purpose; teach you a lesson or help figure out who you are or who you want to become. You never know who these people may be but you lock eyes with them; you know that very moment that they will affect your life in some profound way. And sometimes things happen to you at the time that may seem horrible; painful and unfair; but in reflection you realize that without overcoming those obstacles you would never realize your potential; strength; will power or heart. Everything happens for a reason. Nothing happens by chance or by means of luck. Illness; love; lost moments of true greatness and sheer stupidity all occur to test limits of your soul. Without these small tests; life would be like a smoothly paved; straight; flat road to nowhere safe and comfortable but dull and utterly pointless. The people you meet affect your life. The successes and downfalls that you experience.....</RelCText>

			<RelQSubject>Moving from Dubai to Doha</RelQSubject>
			<RelQBody>My family and I are moving to Doha in August. We want to bring our 2 jeeps with us. I would like to drive both from Dubai to Doha. Can anyone tell me the procedure and paperwork needed? Also; can I drive my wife's car or can a friend drive it for her? And finally can I bring some of our personal effects with us in the car? If anyone can help with these questions that would be great.</RelQBody>

			<RelCText>doha to dubai. first; you can ship one of the cars; i am told it will cost about 2K QAR/AED. you will need to get a transit visa for the drive through saudi; and for this you will need a valid GCC residence visa. aside from this; i would have thought that you just register the car with the ministry of transportation once you are here (but not sure if that involves anything different than what you would need for a car bought here). if your car is too old you won't be able to register it in doha (i think 2006 models are the oldest allowed this year). no idea about the stuff but good question. i wanted to do the same; it would not have occurred to me that this might be a problem.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>i just moved in here. if your visa will be cancelled come august; then i think you can no longer drive it i tried actually all the procedures. if you're planning to export it here through either recovery (trucking) or shipping (container) the first thing you'll do is go to Traffic department; the easiest and less crowded is the one near Al Wasl; 10am is a good time to go there. they will get your vehicle for export test and you have to pay for 25 dhs. then if you tell them you'll bring it to trucking company yourself; you'll pay around 80dhs for the export plates (blue plates) and they will get your old plates and also the registration of your vehicle (card); make sure too you cancel your salik; which has also a booth inside the building. here are the reminders: 1.) insist you'll take the car even with the blue plates; some of the guys will tell you to leave your car with them. with the blue plates; you can drive your car for 14 more days from the day you had the local plates canceled......</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Hi Cath; I'm also planning to take my car from Dubai to Doha. However; I have a couple of issues: 1. I just moved to Qatar a couple of weeks ago and haven't received my Resident Permit yet because they told me I have to cancel my Dubai visa first (even though it's my own investor visa) 2. I'm going to Dubai tomorrow to cancel my visa and then I was planning to come back in my car. Will I be able to obtain the transit visa in Saudi border if I have a Canadian passport? 3. If I get an NOC from my employer in Qatar; will that be sufficient to import my car from Dubai to Doha. 4. Will I have to pay the 5% tax if my car is 3 yrs old? Is there any way to avoid it? Thanks in advance. Noman</RelCText>

			<RelCText>What's the big fuss of changing your position on your VISA? Can you even READ what is written on your PATAQA? Do you go around with; showing everyone your LABOR CONTRACT where it states that you are MANAGER? Does anybody around you care whether you are Manager or not on your VISA? I can't even seem to find the benefit of changing the title; not unless you want to brag around everyone saying 'I've got a Manager's title on my VISA'.

			<RelCText>Hai guys I have been working in qatar since 1995 in a reputed company as a supervisor. The title of my visa was labor.As uyou said it doesn't make any difference until I try to bring my family here; Because we are not able to bring our family if our visa in such title even we are working as a manager ; I canceled my RP while I go on vacation and cameback in new visa as engineer. I heard that even we we can visit UAE for 7 days if we had a engineer or doctor visa (not sure).</RelCText>

Give it to the Lady on the counter together with the charge QR 100 for one year. She will issue one reciept and u can get ur card exactly after one month from the same counter.

			<RelCText>Both KLM and Lufthanza allow you to bring pets from the UK (via Netherlands or Germany) in the cabin. The pet plus the carrier has to weigh under around 8kg (which should be fine for a small breed). Price is surprisingly minimal - it is a fixed excess baggage charge of around £70 (check with airlines). The pet has to be transported in a carrier which fits under the seat (really only during take off and touch down). There are special soft carriers which have a tent-like squashable roof which will fit under the seat and spring back up. The brand that springs to mind is Sturdibag. Good luck! Btw I was told about the airlines by Doha Vets (who were amazingly helpful) and then checked directly with the airlines in the UK; who agreed with this...</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Thank you so much for this information Tiddsmum. Have you had experience of animals travelling this way yourself? I had checked with KLM who said exactly as you have; however when 2 companies in the U.K told me this was not allowed it left me feeling very deflated and wondering if it was maybe Doha Airport that dont accept dogs travelling this way. She is our daughters dog but is a very special part of the family and keeping our teenager onside for this move is very important. I really appreciate your replying as I have tried to obtaining this through other blogs; websites to no evail; all say cargo; excess baggage in hold. I will also contact Doha Vets who may be able to help with import certificate and help upon our arrival.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Get in touch with Dr Khaled El Hossan (khaled@dohavets.com); he can sort all the paperwork out this end. The import licence is valid for 1 month; but it may be worth finding out how long it takes to get one in the first place... All you will need to do is sort out the export papers from DEFRA at UK end - this is the link to the relevant contacts: http://animalhealth.defra.gov.uk/about/contact-us/tradeexports.html Oh; here is an example of the type of carrier: http://www.zooplus.co.uk/ask?q=sturdi+bag&amp;num=20&amp;form=search&amp;gclid=CMbG7c2d468CFQt66wodhz7NwA This is all theory - I had been planning to bring out my elderly cat (who would have been too stressed in the hold); but as we are not staying in Qatar; will now not need to do this. Hope it all goes well for you and your daughter's dog. Have to say though; August is an awfully brutal month to be bringing the poor thing out there; hope it doesn't have a full coat!</RelCText>

			<RelQSubject>Saturday nights in Doha? Qube nightclub?</RelQSubject>
			<RelQBody>Hi all! Me and some friends from london are looking to come over to Doha for a couple of weeks. Whats the party scene like on Friday and Saturday nights? I hear that in Qatar nobody goes out on saturday; is that true? Where would you go for RnB and hiphop? And Ive heard alot about a club called Qube is it any good? Any feedback would be welcome thanks!</RelQBody>

			<RelCText>If you enjoy filipino cover bands and lots of asian variety in the crowd then the Qube is GREAT; however if you enjoy more of the western flair you are down to Garvey's; Rugby Club; and Rydges. Of these your best bet for Fri and Sat night (my OPINION; so no flames from anyone) is going to be Rydges. The bar is under new Aussie management with the goal of MUCH better music and faster service. This past weekend was quite busy and the music was good enough to dance to. So there you hav it; one recommendation</RelCText>

			<RelCText>I agree with Tyler and bbksiu. Although the best way to enjoy your weekend in Doha is by get together with friends in one of our house; have dinner (bbq) and drinks (alcohol) you can buy alcohol if you have the license; play some games (e.g. Risk and Card) watch the latest dvd; you can put music on and DANCE (Becareful your neighbor!!!!) and if you too drunk to go home; your friend can get you a lift; or there always a taxi. So you not worry to get cought on drunk and driving.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>"Amaru Immortal - Clubs (I mean night clubs) here in Qatar are no comparison to what you'd find in a non-muslim country. They both serve alcohol; have music (live/djs) but that's where the comparison ends. ""Where would you go for RnB and hiphop?"" Take a plane and go somewhere else. :-) I'd suggest Heat or Mercury Lounge in Melbourne for RnB/Hip Hop. ;-) (Bit of promotion from an ex-employee) If you still wanna come to the Middle East for clubbing; go to Beirut or Istanbul. Maybe even Cairo for that matter. Or go to Goa; India if you wanna spend Xmas at trance parties on the beaches. Or go pub hopping in Bangalore. ""I hear that in Qatar nobody goes out on saturday; is that true?"" True. We go out on Thursdays. That's the weekend here. Happy hour starts at 5:30pm."</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Bars in Doha (Starting from Rugby Club moving to Marriott)including drink prices; average nationality of customer; musical tastes and % of prostitutes. Rugby Club: Similar to Garveys only maybe 60% British; not as many rig pigs and a lot more 16 year olds. Sometimes a DJ plays. Never seen any pros there either. Nearly impossible to get into now if you don’t have a membership. Average drink price: 15QR Ramada: Orion: Located on the top of the new Ramada Plaza; it's 80% male; mostly Indian/Arab. I've never noticed the music but I think there's a Filipino band some nights. Average drink price: 30 QR Manhatten: Tiny little bar also located in Ramada Plaza. 99% Qatari men. Average drink price: 40 QR Bubbles: 50% men/50% women usually in couples with a good line of Qatari's holding up the bar. Serves champagne/cocktails and has a singer and piano player that play too loudly. Average drink price: 50QR Sherazad: The sports bar in the old Ramada. 70% men; Indian/Arab/Western. 30% Prostitute. .....</RelCText>

Though i think its hard to get inside especially on thursday night i just found last night while making a detour you know the traffic! While i was driving i see this long line little did i know its a line to get inside this new club...do you think its own by Ramada Hotel? anyway its a good thing they are already permitting building clubs!</RelQBody>

			<RelCText>i went tuesday; i thaught it was pretty poor tbh; lots of working women and a bad philipino coversband playing rock ballards of the 80s. the design is interesting; nothing like a propper nightclub; far too bright; no disco lighting; very restrictive about upstairs couples/vip area. it reminded me of nightclubs you see in american movies-pretty synthetic and fake. i couldnt work out the booze pricing policy a Bourbon and coke cost the same price as a coke; and everyone from work had rank hangovers despite quitting at 11.30 yes its owned and staffed by ramada.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>I went on Thursday and had a good time with some friends. I thought the band was pretty good; maybe I was hypnotized by the daisy duke shorts the singers were wearing though. Everyone that had went before me summed it up as feeling like a warehouse and it's mostly due to the white walls I think. Kinda reminded me of a high school dance in the gymnasium; buncha guys standing around leering at the girls. Hopefully after the Asian Games they will take everyone's advice and at least paint the walls and dim the lights to iimprove the atmosphere of the place. The ratio of guys to girls was about the same as everywhere else; 10 guys to 1 girl.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Well if thats what you want to go to the Doha night clubs for then thats your deal. Night life in Qatar hmmmm is there such a thing? From what I can tell they are full of Philipino women and old western men with a few other undesirables in. Doha amongst many other cities in the world have a lot to learn about night clubs; what makes them good and what makes them bad. Predominantly what makes them bad are the clients that frequent them; in the case of Doha they will always be bad. Face facts if you got to a nightclub to pick up women (of any culture) then your not in to clubbing!</RelCText>

			<RelCText>To the majority of people whom have attended real clubs; go for the music; to get dressed up to impress not only others but themselves. Many clubs are just institutions to carry on drinking after normal club closing time and to pick up members of the opposite sex. Real clubbing....IS.... music; dancing not what has been described on here. This is not just my opinion; there are many clubbing web pages; and you will find it hard pressed to find a description of what is described on this forum. Have you ever been to Ibiza? granted the drug scene is far to prevalent there but it is all about fun music and dancing; not about picking up women!</RelCText>

			<RelCText>aw come on its not that bad. there are about 5 places which are fun to go for drinks and a dance at nighttime. maybe 6. they are all quite different; one is snobby (the Pearl) one is for middle aged people and is always packed (Paloma) one has a mix of american and indian music and is really really smoky (Cloud Nyn); one is massive and has a very gay (as in kitch) cover band doing 80s stuff (Qube); one is british but i dont go there (garveys) and one is just the right size with awesome music and a good atmosphere (admirals).</RelCText>

			<RelCText>I think it shouldn't be taken as just dance and drinks for nightlife. I suffer from lackness of cultural events in Doha. As I missed Anatolian Fire; Madame Butterfly under Asian Games events; I would like to see such entertaining performances more in Doha. Much more that if we can not find any place for one ; we can go for the other:D For example; there are some nice places making wonderful fruit cocktails; why not play bowling while you drink? A big complex with bowling; billiard; electronic games for adults strongly required... About Alaaddin's Kingdom;it is the only theme park with nothing! It should be more inviting...with some little theatre shows; animal shows; high quality electronic video games; good food; some recreation near sea... In Turkey; they make people to sit on camels for a little tour and take photograph; sorry I couldn't see any camels since I came here(9 months). About sea side; Doha has a wonderful corniche people just go and sit on grass; why there isn't some caf.....</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Any one who compares the two cities proves hes hasnt been to one of them. As someone who just came back from UAE last week; doha is not even close to what abu dhabi is right now. No contest. AD has much much much more social/night life; infrastructure is generations ahead; the roads in abu dhabi are second to none; traffic is well taken care of and life in general is much better. Women are way way way nicer and much more social as well. Build quality of the houses is far ahead of what is available in doha and the city is much cleaner; greener and about a million times better organized. As for roads; ill put it this way; i was at the officers club in Abu Dhabi late for my flight. So I told my taxi driver (mercedes e class wagon) to plz hurry to the airport. He was driving at 200-220kph only slowing down to 140kph for the cameras; and drove at that speed for a good 10 mins; and had me at my destination well before time. Roads in Abu dhabi are AMAZING. Abu dhabi is the richest city in the.....</RelCText>

			<RelCText>As some of you have suggested; to apply for permanent residency in Canada is pretty straight forward o majority of the cases.  The Green Card is only referring to permanent resident of the States; not Canada.  Also; the color of the card for permanent resident card has been changed to white color many yaers ago though most people still refer to green card. To qualify for Canadian permanent resident visa; you  need to accumulate a total of 67 points (used to be 75 points) which are based on your age; education level; profession; employment status; english proficiency; suitability; and among others.  Just go to the official canadian immigration website as stated above and u will get all the info.  God luck~!</RelCText>

			<RelCText>doesn't matter what you are going through! Canada Immigration officer doesn't care about it. He/She is strictly following the procedure; rules and instructions. and by the way this is the first thing you guys have to learn about canada. You have to be loyal and law obedient and rules respectful. No fooling around; no playing games; no middle-eastern tricks and focus-pocuses! If you have gained enough points on six factors; you become eligible to APPLY for the Immigration.

			<RelCText>greentea; it's not necessary; but some assistance of the experienced individual might be very helpful! Sometimes everything goes smooth and easy. Sometimes there are hidden problems on the way. Filling up the application is a very first and easiest step of the process. On the other hand; if the information provided in the application form is correct and TRUTHFUL; and based on this information the person is eligible for the immigration process; it shouldn’t be any issue with that.. but sometimes some unpredictable things happen.. here is the example. 5 points are given for the relatives in Canada. Let’s say the applicant has a sister who possesses a Resident status in Canada. While filling in the application; the applicant adds 5 points to his score; and it helps him to get 67 points. But.. once the Immigration Office asks for the documents to prove the claims in the initial application. And then it turns out; that a sister doesn’t live in Canada at all. She lives; let’s say in .....</RelCText>

			<RelCText>"Honesty on the application is a different matter. Thats down to morals and common sense. A lawyer or consultant is not all that helpful. If you have questions about the application you can usually find it on the site. If any questions arise the embassy will call you. Also dont believe them when they say their clients never get interviews; these are also random and if you are on the up and up no worries. A lawyer/consultant will cost you between 2000-3000 $. Totally not worth it; Just make sure you have all the required docs etc together and understand the process from the site before applying.

			<RelCText>my lawyer gave me the forms to fill up then send him back the forms and the documents to go with it. later he met me again to review the filled up forms (in adobe format this time) then if entries are correct and no changes made; i signed it then send it back to him again. after a few months; he send me the file number. that's it for 2 years i did not hear from him again. i just have to check the website for the status of my application using my file number. the next time i heard from him; he advised me to download again the same forms from the website and fill it up; sign; follow the list of exhibits to be submitted that are not yet submitted earlier then submit direct to high commission of canada within 90 days from the date the letter was issued. good thing i made a photocopy of my original documents to avoid discrepancies. so basically; in the end you still have to send updated forms direct to the high commission</RelCText>

You have to live in Canada 3 years out of 4 to be eligible to apply for the Citizenship. It means if you don’t leave Canada for 3 years at all; then you can apply.. in case you go back and forth; you have to collect 1095 days during 4 years.

			<RelCText>"I don't understand the question. Surely you must have decided before you apply WHY you want to go to a particular country. If it is just to have a ""western"" passport who cares? Canada is cold for much of the year; Austalia is warmer but has some ""hotspots"" sometimes. This is not a very specific question. To be honest. If you are going to any other country other than to reside there permanently. You are not emigrating for legitimate reasons. You are emigrating to get the passport - what is the matter with your birth country's passport?"</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Every country is getting strict on their immigration... Recently Australia has announced some insane changes in their immigration policies.... Every country requires that one should live in its country but people use to live anywhere else after getting immigration. Now they realized and changed their policies and forcing immigrants to live in the country otherwise they will not renew the residency... But I was thinking if they do not increase their birth rate and skill sets; they have to soften their policies for immigrants :)</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Very much depend on your reason for migrating. Is it economic opportunity; education; life styles and anything else not the least; which country will accept you. As general rule; for economic migrants (I assume you are; apology if wrong) from Ghana (Your profile); both are good. Never live in Canada so I can not comment but for Australia as someone else mention; there are a bit of resistance from earlier migrant (after all Australian aside from the indigeous people are migrants or convicts at some stage of history) about allowing more to come. Basically it affect mid level skilled person/tradesman such as cooks; hairdresser; carpenter; electricians etc. For higher qualifications (engineers; doctors); I believe the door is still open. Cheers SK BTW; if you decide to go to Australia; you DO NOT need to enggage the service of a migration agent. They mostly act as an administrative assistant (ie. reminding you of which document to submit etc) and have no impact on your selectibility.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Qatarisun and Marycatherine … are you trying to give me bad impression about Canada people or what? I think you are trying to do that but you cannot because you do not represent Canada people in this forum. Actually I know some good people from Canada and they told me more about Canada. But I just asked this question to hear from foreigners who lived in Canada before or still living there. This is because foreigners experience in a country cannot be the same as that of citizens. I am wondering why you think I want to immigrate to Canada….. Or go there for passport …where didn’t I mention that? It is very funny hahaa Does my question about immigration mean that I want to immigrate to Canada? Why don’t you that it could be research purpose or any other thing else? I don’t think we should think one way! Especially when we have job tiles like teacher or manager etc …….we shouldn’t think like someone who hasn’t been to school.

			<RelCText> Yes; Smoke is right. You can definitely take his advice. My friend was having very big Canadian dreams. He knew about the initial 3 years struggle. He was well prepared mentally as well as physically also with a strong financial back-up. He was ready to do any kind of odd jobs...which you have to do in Canada as your educational qualifiaction beomes simply 10+2 as soon as you land in there. My friend was a well settled Dentist in India....he just couldn't get any Dental assistant job too. He never ever yold us that what he had to go thru in his 4 months stay in Toranto. He came back to India after 4 mths with a huge hole in pocket. Again after completing a costly course in Gemology; he went there to try his luck again. And this time too he returned after 2 months again with a huge hole in pocket. I am not writing this to discourage your brother. This is ground reality one must know before proceeding for it. Still I know those too who had gone thru all the struggle and now are well se.....</RelCText>

			<RelCText>I would strongly suggest you skip the recruiter. You can fill in all the documents on your own - look for the Canadian embassy in Kuwait in Google and you will find all that you need there. Unless you have lots of money; skills that are in demand (and papers to prove your qualifications); or are a refugee; it is very difficult to get in to Canada. It can take years for the papers to get through so if someone has told you 10 months; that is probably completely unrealistic.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>"There is no such thing as birth tourism in Canada. In fact; you will probably either be denied a visa or turned away at immigration if there is any suspicion that you are there solely to give birth.

			<RelCText>Yes it DOES exist and it still is legal to have your baby both in the States and Canada as a visitor.Anyone who is born in USA and Canada is automatically deemed to be citizen regardless of the parent's status or residency or citizenship. There are such agencies back home in Hong Kong; Singapore and Seoul. Just type it on google I am sure you'll find a few...Young Asian couples are really into this idea. In fact; my younger sister did it in Canada about a year ago. So my niece has become Canadian by birth and has gotten a Canadian passport. Neither my brother-in-law nor my sister were Canadian resident or citizen at the time of birth. The OB-GYN; the housing and the hospital all cost them around 30.000USD. They did it in Toronto and stayed in a furnished home for three months. My sis said everything went good and that they never were treated badly just because they happen to have a baby there as non-residents. So I think it's for sure worth doing if you want the US or Canadian citizens.....</RelCText>

			<RelCText>It is NOT legal to operate as a birth tourism company to have a child in Canada. Canada confers citizenship automatically on babies born there NOT on their parents who CAN and ARE deported; thereby separating families. THIS IS A SCAM to try and gain access to Canadian citizenship by circumventing the immigration rules and regulations by having a baby in Canada. Immigration in Canada is well aware of this and do take steps to circumvent it. Again; I ask; why don't you want YOUR child to have YOUR nationality?</RelCText>

	<OrgQBody>Hey there guys! I'm moving out to Doha to start work with the Ta'allum Group in Doha as a primary school teacher at (I think!) the Al Maha Academy for Boys. Is anybody else moving out there? Does anybody know where they're supposed to be living yet? I haven't had all the info from the school yet.

			<RelCText>Winnie Park House has currently closed its waiting list for all years. I have two children at PHES and so far have been pleased. One is in year 10 and hates the uniform; the school the teachers..... I think he is settling in nicely. We had to wait until last week (end of Sept) to get a place for my daughter in reception year. But the facilities in the primary section are good. The class rooms are bright airey clean and inviting. They have canopyed areas for the children to play outside. The school is small (about 600 including secondary); but they are currently building further extensions for sixth form. They moved into these premises over a year ago. All the teachers I have met are enthusiastic and bubbly. The head teacher Mrs Brennan is very approachable and ameniable. They have a very pragmatic approach to education and have adopted the British healthy schools policy. There is no canteen so its invent as many ways as possible to make a sandwiche look interesting for the next 10 year.....</RelCText>

			<RelCText>I was just this morning talking to a colleague who has two kids at Park House as I am considering sending my own daughter there. The feedback is very positive. Good facilities (they have now got their new place and are no longer using the Russian Embassy building). Apparently the teachers are very kind but also exert a strong sense of discipline and manners (cell phones are not allowed). They have recently started offering the International Baccalaureate. Everything I have heard about Park House has been very positive.</RelCText>

Tell him to buy a copy of the Marhaba in Carrefours supermarket in City Centre. that lists all events happening in Q and where to go. It is updated every season.

			<RelCText>I have emailed you directly as I am sure there is more knowledge you can share with me. Do you live in a villa or apartment. Our company has provided us with a new 3 bed apartment and I do not know what it will be like with a 7yr old; he is used to playing out on his bike etc... I suppose as I will not be working I will have to keep him occupied - any good places for children to play/met etc.. We already have a copy of Marhaba which has been useful. I think Ramadan is the biggest problem at the moment. My husband has a company vehicle but I think I will have to get a car to do the school runs etc.. do you think I could hire one initially? or lease? Who does your husband work for. My husband is working very long hours at the moment as they are so busy - keeps him out of mischief I suppose!</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Hi guys I couldt help myself but this topic has caught my attention; reason being is that we have an appointment with PHES school this week to enrol my two sons; im guessing one will be year 6 and the other year 8; from what ive heard about the school it has a really good reputaion and just been new to doha now 3 weeks werve been told that there are now spaces available; we did try doha but no luck there not until next year; so it will be interesting to see what happens; didnt realise getting your kids into a school in qatar would be more difficult than getting a job anywhwere in the country.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>lostboy where are you doing your early morning ride? I could ride on saturdays and sundays. I have both road and Mt. bike here. for those of you coming to doha soon I don't see the cooled path ever happening around the corniche. that area is the jewel of doha. there are 2 places that I know of that sell decent road bikes but $$$$$. My advise is mail your bike here! and make it a mt. bike. I have not seen any place to ride on the road safe in doha; there is some nice roads to ride out of town but you would need to drive and then ride.</RelCText>

Al-Jazeera's troubled English language news channel is facing a ""serious staffing crisis"" after scores of journalists left or have not had contracts renewed amid claims of a revolt over working conditions. Staff at the Doha-based 24-hour news channel - which only reached its first birthday in November - have told MediaGuardian.co.uk of a series of issues including the removal of benefits and a lack of pay rises which have led many to resign or look to leave. The staff unrest comes amid speculation that al-Jazeera English is set to relaunch in the second quarter of this year with new schedules and new studios in Gaza and Nairobi. According to insiders; resignations have occurred across the board; including the director of human resources; the director of operations; producers; senior camera operators and editors.

Their website looks good; but of course there is no substitute for a personal visit.

			<RelCText>My son was in the primary school last year and it was awful. Fortunately I was able to get him in a new school this year and am SO happy we left. There is a new principal at AJA this year but she is untested. The IPC program is crap quality and poorly implemented..teachers are belligerent...fighting and bullying are everyday occurences. Large number of Qatari students and what goes with it. Unfortunately my daughter is still in the secondary school and I am trying hard to get her out as well. Now he is at Newton Internt'l school and we both are enormously happy- have you tried them?</RelCText>

I even went to thailand and trained kickboxing there in the Fiartex camp i stayed there a long time basically life was training all day. I came across Krav Maga when i first started Jui Jitsu; there was a guy teaching it in town and it got alot of hype it was very effectively advertized in the united states and it attracted many people of the age-group 21years+ ; I think the organization made most of its money selling single women a false-sense of security in that if they learnt this they could take on any person in a dark parking lot.

	<OrgQSubject>Anybody else moving out to teach in January?</OrgQSubject>
	<OrgQBody>Hey there guys! I'm moving out to Doha to start work with the Ta'allum Group in Doha as a primary school teacher at (I think!) the Al Maha Academy for Boys. Is anybody else moving out there? Does anybody know where they're supposed to be living yet? I haven't had all the info from the school yet.

			<RelCText>They don't have to do simple things like tests to get a liscense; they are given the keys to massive SUV's with little or no experience acutally driving a vehicle; they have little or no respect for traffic laws or anyone else on the road; they have speed issues in that anything under 120 kms an hour is two slow. There is no way that the women have any side vision in their veils; they have no idea how to actually drive in a round about...That enough? I could go on.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>How long have you been in Qatar? I do not think you have been here longâ€¦. If you are new and you drive; then wait and see a few Land Cruisers cut you off; make your heart come to your mouth with their speed limit breaking speeds and piss you off by flashing their lights behind you in the fast lane and honking at you at roundabouts like they got shit in their pants. I have been here for 15 years and I have not seen anything change with regards to the way Qatariâ€™s drive. Like MunozC Mentioned itâ€™s a downright attitude problem... They just think; I can drive in my country the way I like and get away with it; you drive and be careful and weep when you try to mess with me. I have friends who have had skirmishes with these guys at times and they have insulted them and even gone to the extent of try to hit them when they have been proved wrong; right in front of the cops. One Indian friend was insulted so bad that the Qatari guy said you Indians are at par with my shoes an.....</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Yes; and this made it doubly gob-smacking to be hit with a 'you're copped' parking ticket outside Hamad Hospital this week for parking on the kerb (200 yards away from the entrance - I simply needed to catch up with my son who had arrived in an ambulance) - surreal stuff and so unfair!!!!!</RelCText>

			<RelCText>The flashing lights thing really irks my nerves. I stay in the lane when they do it. If someone drives up behind me and they don't flash their lights or get right on the back of my car; I move. I have respect for the patient people here. I'm a fast driver but these people are nuts. I drive fast when I know I have a clearing. I have seen people speed through compounds. I find it nice that when you're on a 2 lane road and there is a bit of a wait at the r/a; people make 4 lanes. Crazy.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>It would be good if the Police (or traffic Police)first follow proper driving techniques/rules. ie: 1) hands free phone or preferable park and then speak on the phone. 2) follow speed limit. 3) not drive over footpath in private cruiser with uniform on. 4) immediate fine to anyone driving while holding the phone; or child on drivers lap; or driver with foot on the dashboard; or without seatbelt. 5) point system should be started in Qatar as most of the people breaking the law have the necessary funds. The list can go on. These are the ones I think need immediate attention. the first three points apply to the Police.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>In fairness it's not just the Qatari's that are poor drivers; but alot of expats as well. Allowing your children to roam around in a moving vehicle is not only dangerous; but stupid. Road accidents cause 62 deaths in seven months DOHA â€¢ The death toll in road accidents in the country was higher at 62 between January and July this year and a total of 107 people were left critically injured; a local Arabic daily reported yesterday citing figures from the Department of Traffic and Patrol Police. A majority of the deaths (36) occurred in the satellite township of Al Rayyan; followed by Madinat Khalifa (18) and Old Airport Area in Doha (05). At least 700 cases of road accidents were referred to the courts over the seven-month period. A total of 6;654 accidents took place during the period; while minor accidents totallled an incredible 26;697. PLEASE; wear seat-belts; buckle-up your children and drive safely!!!</RelCText>

			<RelCText>The Westbay CC area is pretty small; so you should be able to drive yourself around and visit each building. (maybe a dozen buildings) I think they all have onsite management that can show you what is available. Personally; I think the Pearl and Falcon Towers adjacent to the 4 Seasons Hotel are the best units and best located especially if you are able to join the Four Seasons Spa / Health Club. Al Farden Tower (where the BMW dealer is located) is very nice; but no balconies if that is important to you. 44 Westbay Tower also has very nice units and great views from the upper floors. The residences at the W Hotel are also quite nice; but no balconies.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>See other threads regarding petshops. My only experience was in one about 7 years ago in Doha; and I have never set foot in one again. If you look at some recent threads you will find many people have had shocking experiences in some local petshops that sell live animals. If its petfood or supplies you are after try Rider Trading; Carrefour; Landmark; etc. Most supermarkets stock pet food and some basic supplies. Rider tends to stock food and even more supplies and will often get particulars in if you have something in mind. If its a pet you are after see threads of dogs/cats being given away. Or scan through this board looking for posts relating to Qatar Animal Welfare Society (QAWS.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Alyson; you can get Royal Canin for cats here; I always buy the hairball control at Doha Vets. If they don't have the specific for persians; they'll probably order it for you. I think their website is www.dohavets.com or something like that. If I may suggest; if you use an enclosed litter box; bring one with you; as they are very expensive here (QR250 for a really cheap looking one). Also bring toys; they are not easy to find here. And stuff like nail clipper as well. Oh; and frontline is also quite expensive here; and I haven't found the specific one for cats; the vet told me to simply put less of the dog one. Anyway; those are the things you should know if you're bringing kittie with you.</RelCText>

			<RelQSubject>Pet snake?</RelQSubject>
			<RelQBody>Good evening everyone!! I hope you had a fantabulous weekend! Anyway; I was wondering where I could buy/adopt a pet snake. Preferably a ball python; corn snake or a pretty king snake as I'm still a beginner at handling snakes. I love exotic animals (I already have a tarantula; a wolf spider and lemur) If you know where I could get some piranha that would be awesome! I wanna get some for my uncles birthday cause he just loves them!!</RelQBody>

But why are you worrying? There is a huge expat population here; which includes Indians; Europeans; Americans and even Australians. So; it's not a problem basically. Ask Sunny to be prudent and approach the things casually; without any pre-conceived notions; though caution is utmost required.

			<RelCText>Life is not easy if you are a Western Woman; and the main reason a man from this part of the world would want a western woman is mainly for sex. However; please do not for one moment think that the men and women here con't have premarital relationships - they do it just not talked about and it is not caried out in the open. Due to the conservative background of the boys they will always return to their families and it would be vry difficult for them to marry outside the families would not be happy about it. I think it is much better to be very cautious out here although there are a great many handsome men and they can be very charming going through the Arab and Asian world of men they are all interested in SEX. One of the things is that being found to be together whoc ae not married can get into very deep trouble here - just a little food for thought.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Sadly this has been the case for many years. Maybe it originally stems from the days when arabs had loads of money; visited capital cities (mainly in the West) and were naturally surrounded (as they were rich) by hookers. Word spread when they returned that they had been with western women. The assumption would then be made that all Western women were loose. That is the assumption that we came to many years ago.

			<RelCText>Body sugaring is a method for removing body hair that is a cheap; homemade alternative to waxing (or shaving). The theory behind body sugaring is that the hair is removed by the root; and when it grows back there will be less of it; and it will be softer and not stubbly as it is if a razor had been used. Body sugaring is done by making a paste of sugar; water; and lemon juice that has been heated to the softball candy stage. http://www.care2.com/greenliving/ancient-egyptian-body-sugaring.html# Sounds painful already......</RelCText>

			<RelCText>"The men's part of the wedding is pretty straight forward. Invitees congratulate the groom and his father; brothers... You sit next to him for the traditional coffee and tea; have a picture taken with him. Later on there's a buffet and an ""'ardha"" which is a traditional sword dance. Very nice; beautifully decorated garments. After that groom goes to the women's party and joins the bride. At least these are my first-hand observations. There's no ""down and dirty"" part there."</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Don't hate me diamondgirl....this certainly does not apply to everyone....but my personal experience here in doha is that MOST do not speak english. Even people who are not local and come from the subcontinent and claim to speak english do not understand you or prove able to articulate their thoughts in english. I'm not trying to upset anyone; but i'm calling it like I see it. This is a true story: I called the information number provided on the Qatar Foundation website to get some information on the American universities you hear so much hype about; and was shunted through 4 different people who could not speak english! This isn't an obscure gvt office in the ministry of islamic studies or whatever....this was QATAR Foundation!! SO: No! English is not a main language in Qatar...and is mostly spoken by the European and North American Expat communities only. Stay safe all. Perfection does not exist.

Now not wishing to offend anyone but Arabic and English are the main business languages; however; Indians have derived their onw english after the British left and even I have difficulty understanding many of them. Wen I go to a shope and there is and Indian salesman I have to aske at least three times what he is saying ans this is meant seriously; there are other whose English is wonderful. Most people in Government positions are well versed in English although I have to admit we there are a nuber of employees who speak very little English. You seem to have encountered the very few that don't speak english. May I add this comment here; many more Arabs speak English than English speaking races speak Arabic.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>It could very well be true. Qatarization is a very high priority here. But with that said; saying that Qataris should fill secretarial positions and getting them to do so are two different things. A national is going to have to want the job before the job is Qatarized. I'm not sure how this would be handled so I don't see it happening overnight. I'm not sure if this refers to replacing people already in positions or for new positions opening up. One would like to think that expats will keep their job until their contract runs out at least. Also - it could be that a qualified Qatari is given first opportunity at a new position and if it isn't filled then it can be opened up to expats. In any event - it will take time to sort out.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>"I can see it happening overnight indeed. In my organization we have four administrative positions sitting empty that have been reserved for Qataris. No one wants them; we had one woman for a while; but she quit after a month as her husband thought that it was too far for her to drive. What silliness; we can't hire anyone to fill the positions as they are reserved for Qataris; but we can't find any Qataris willing to take the jobs; and nothing is getting done. Why are administrative positions considered to be ""unskilled"" anyway? A good admin assistant is worth their weight in gold."</RelCText>

			<RelCText>"the ""pecking"" order for jobs has always been Qatari first; second was other arab and third was any other nationality. Admin jobs (particularly HR) have always been seen as an easy Qatarisation option. It's not like an operational job where; if somebody screws up; there's often a big bang or an accident. HR and its systems can slowly deteriorate with no apparent effect......until the system does collapse and by then it's often too late. Enter the expats again to sort things out. One comment.

			<RelCText>without government approval of your marriage; you won't get a family visa back into Qatar; unfortunately. Marrying you out of the country can cause major problems for your fiance; so I would suggest you wait until your marriage is approved. The only other option is that you relocate somewhere else; marry there; but your marriage will not be valid in Qatar; and you will have no claim to any inheritences if god forbid; something should happen to him. Does your fiance not have some Wasta; that can obtain your release from your company? I am not saying that will make things any easier; since you still need to have the govt approval for marriage; but at least you can be in Qatar; near him.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Would openly list countries where homosexuality is outlawed to be a vagabond nations. The matter of homosexuality is by far a much disputed affair among people of various religions; creeds and races; that to simply state it's right and all those who condemn it for any reason is wrong; will not be as simple. That said if they wish to protect those who are gay and transgenders from oppression and mistreatment then I suppose they have all the liberty to do so; however yes they should also then open their eyes to all the oppression committed around the world at large;and work towards stamping them out; and not just pick and choose to their convenience which has clearly been the case with UN in the recent times; which has caused people around the globe to hold them in contempt for; and not take them seriously.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>I came back from Europe last week with 2+ kilos in my checked bag - as did at least a dozen others on the same flight. Alcohol will be confiscated; no doubt about it; but the pork seems to be winked at as it goes through the scanner. I've never heard of anyone being detained or arrested for bringing either into the country - the alcohol was simply confiscated and they were warned not to try and bring it again. Nationality and ethnicity may play a role here. I'm a white Western middleaged female. Asian and other people of colour may have a different experience and perhaps someone can speak to that point. Many Westerners here travel to UAE or Bahrain and bring back pork with no incident (in my 2+ years here).</RelCText>

			<RelCText>The web site doesn't mention it; but I'm pretty sure you need your RP (Resident's Permit) before you get a liquor licence; and that'll take a few weeks. Most people need much less than their allowance; so if you find a friendly licence holder with spare capacity; you should be OK.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>The web site doesn't mention it; but I'm pretty sure you need your RP (Resident's Permit) before you get a liquor licence; and that'll take a few weeks. Most people need much less than their allowance; so if you find a friendly licence holder with spare capacity; you should be OK.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Get a letter from your employer giving you permission; basically a no objection letter. The letter also needs to state your salary as the amount of liquor you may buy depends on that.

			<RelCText>I just applied for a permit last night with my husband; who is here under my sponsorship. We were issued a joint permit; with a shared limit based on my salary; but we each received our own card. My husband just arrived and is not yet employed. If you are not employed; and if your father were willing to apply with you; perhaps you could get a joint family permit. I have had to write a no objection letter in order for my husband to apply for a driver's license since he is here under my sponsorship; so perhaps your father could do the same for the liquor permit if you are employed and want your own permit. If your father doesn't want you to have a permit; I think you are out of luck. :-) As a side note; my permit was issued with a limit at well under the 10% of monthly salary I have read about. Mine was issued at about 5% of my monthly salary.</RelCText>

The only conditon is that the RP/ ID card should be valid at the time of application.

			<RelCText>Any one who compares the two cities proves hes hasnt been to one of them. As someone who just came back from UAE last week; doha is not even close to what abu dhabi is right now. No contest. AD has much much much more social/night life; infrastructure is generations ahead; the roads in abu dhabi are second to none; traffic is well taken care of and life in general is much better. Women are way way way nicer and much more social as well. Build quality of the houses is far ahead of what is available in doha and the city is much cleaner; greener and about a million times better organized. As for roads; ill put it this way; i was at the officers club in Abu Dhabi late for my flight. So I told my taxi driver (mercedes e class wagon) to plz hurry to the airport. He was driving at 200-220kph only slowing down to 140kph for the cameras; and drove at that speed for a good 10 mins; and had me at my destination well before time. Roads in Abu dhabi are AMAZING. Abu dhabi is the richest city in the.....</RelCText>

And yes; the products were absolutely genuine. Sme brans i bought were estee lauder; loreal; bobbi brown. So; are there such shops in Doha too? If yes; please give me their location.

			<RelCText>its quiet; but you can find things to do if you really want to. Now..being happy will depend on a lot of things; to be honest. Are you single..do you have a very active night life...etc... I don't have a curfew..I think that might depend upon what job you have and the requirements. Active night life..there is one but its limited. I see you are from the UK..will be honest with you and say its nothing like the pub scene back there. Clubs and pubs are located ONLY in hotels. Easy to get around if you drive..but you have to be aggressive in your driving manner and defensive...;) I just like it here; for many many reasons...but you DO need to look at all the perspectives before coming here. ONE main one is that the riyal is pegged to the dollar..NOT the English Pound...</RelCText>

			<RelCText>No objection letter require only in that case; if you wish to buy the car on your's company name i-e if the company is going to give you cash to go and buy the car on your own choice but under company's name. But if you are buying car for your personal use; only for your home and for other transporations purpose; no need any kind of letters. Just go to traffic department with the owner of car; fill the form; submit your copy of I.D and Insurance.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>You'd need an NOC (No objection certificate) if your company is not a government firm. Secondly; you would not need an NOC if you're here in Qatar on your husband's sponsorship. You'd need an NOC if your company sponsored your visa even if you're married and you stay with your husband in Qatar. Hope this helps!</RelCText>

One of my friend's sister who is working in one of private company and off course under its sponsorship. she got the car and changed the ownership of the car with out No objection letter. And this all process done by my self and her brother. First day we went and asked for the requirement and they said no need. And we have done this process in two days. Yes its quite possible may be at the time ownership; they are looking to company's name. May be from some companys they need this.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>As you told it is your 2nd sponsor; it mean you transfor your old visa to the new sponsor; so i think he dont have any problem to give you release bcoz he did'nt buy your visa; he hired you localy; but even though everything is in his hand; most of the companies are not giving release; bcoz they bought visas and if they release it mean they are giving visa; but in your case you just transfor your visa to the new company; so i think if you request him when he is in good mood; i hope he'll deal you good; InshaAllah BEST OF LUCK</RelCText>

			<RelCText>if you walk on a plane while is moving as fast as speed of light than the time on a plane is slower than the time on earth.and even you walk inside of plan while it's in speed of light your speed will remain same as the plain b cuz of gravitational force it create inside of the plane wont allow you to walk or run more than the plan speed.even in that speed your clock will start to work slow than the earth time.so technically you are traveling to the future faster with the help of speed.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>"Sorry Tracey; I can see what I wrote was very unclear. And yes; as you say July 28 is being predicted as the ""first day of Eid""; so bars may reopen on July 29.

			<RelCText>Alphy; since her Work visa was rejected; what make you thinking that switching any other type of visa to Work visa will be easier? You misunderstand the process. MOL doesn't know where the perosn is. They don't even care whether the person is here in qatar or back home. They either ISSUE a work visa or they do not! Once the Work visa is approved and issued; then either the person is coming to Qatar (if he/she is outside of qatar) or switches his/her present visa status (tourist/family/business) to Work visa. But the Work visa must be approved and issued in any case regardless to where the person is. So it absolutely doesn't matter where she is. You will only waste your money and time bringing her on tourist visa and getting rejection of her work visa again. Does your compnay have a quota for indian female in the first place? it is very difficult to get nowadays..</RelCText>

			<RelCText>The answer is NO. There's no such thing as NOC from hotel visa ok? hotel visa is valid only; based on your stay in the hotel in Qatar. That's it. If you want her to come here in Doha; it is either you sponsor her(from your company); or complete her CV and submit it to companies which has vacancies. Some companies(ones they accepted the application of the employee) shoulder the visa from the country of origin; ticket to Doha; etc. That's what I did. I'm not sure why your company rejected her application. Maybe you should try other companies. Goodluck! Ciao.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>laidahmad agree with sanooj. -who were u trying to bring? if close family members usually there is no problem; but i know many who saw refusal to bring mother-in-law; or distant relatives -is ur accomodation a family one? if ur contract says bachelor accomodation is provided; than they may refuse it. -is ur occupation compatible with the 9000 qr? a driver/maid/construction worker for example (just an example; no bashing) say that he gets 9.000; the commission may doubt it. just ask them why they refused the application; and accordingly bring proofs (rental copy or a kahrama bill to proove a family accomo; 6 months bank statement if they doubt ur salary; family documents to prouve family ties;...)</RelCText>

			<RelCText>IN THE CASE FAMILY VISIT VISA; - marriage certificate or birth certificate need NOT to be attested. - NO need of Company Letter for each; only one letter but copy should be attached with each applications. - No need of Baladiya Stamp on Rental Agreement. Just to get a Rental Agreement from a Real Estate License holder. Try to prepare all the documents before you go to MOI. If one they rejected; it is very difficult to get it approved.

Go for spa in Al Sharq.  Go have a drink... try the night life... try cinema 9 at city center one of those has nice couch... try horse back riding... learning how to motorbike... try skating... try moroccan food...  try indian food... filipino food... thai food... try playing a ps3... try wii... sorry.... got carried away....  hunt for new gadgets; doha has quiet good priced items.  laptops are cheaper here compared in most countries. The high demand for it has brought down the prices... if i wasn't able to help you still... there are lots of groups who always socialize every weekends... there's some nationalistic groups; art groups; religious groups; hobby groups... you'll be able to find them in book guides like marhaba/ qatar ha.....</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Here are a few (not tried and tested) but you can always get adventorous : 1. Ask personal questions to the most snobish salesman at a snobish outlet. 2. Talk in a higly accented english with the same snobish salesman (rehearse beforehand- another way to kill time). 3. Give a fake smile to people at corniche. Make it snappy like a flash. 4. Make funny/scary faces at kids on corniche. 5. Make a list of all swear words you know and keep the list ready for use (in purse/besides phone/in your car). 6. If you are working than prepare a list of important phone numbers in the smallest font possible and stick it on your computer monitor with a bright sticker. Think and analyse the reaction of your work mates on weekends. Bye and cheers.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Thanks; how awesome; I was thinking it was more like 1.5 hours from what everyone has said about Doha traffic!! :) Being here in the USA is a bit difficult to find out what areas are best to live in Doha... My husband and I love being at home; we prefer high rises with a nice gym though given we are bringing motorcycles over I am thinking somthingh is a garage might be best. We have no kids so schools and having other kids around us is not a top priority. Given this; which areas/buildings would you guys recommend? We don't want to commute more than say 30-40 minutes each way if we can help it (to and from new DOHA airport). What information is there out there about the Pearl; I imagine is still is mostly a huge construction site but are there finished buildigns there worth commuting to and from? Are shoping areas and restaurants nearby already finished? Thanks so much! Kiki</RelCText>

			<RelCText>"Qatar's property development websites are misleading as most of Qatar itself. What you see is not what you'll get. Lusail is a ""planned new city"" due to open soon but you go there now; all you'll se is an empty desert land with maybe 2 tower cranes. Pearl is nearly completed but with a lot of infrastructure and other nature problems. Both locations are at the north outskirts limits of the city; while the new airport is being built at the southern outskirt limit of the city. You do have to across the whole city and the traffic here is another nightmare (not only the traffic jams but also the aggressive and risk driving local style). If no traffic; it will be a 20-30 minutes drive. The best location for you would be near by the Marriott Hotel. A friendly advice: be prepared for the biggest frustrations you ever experienced at professional and social levels and you won't be disappointed. I wish you all the best!"</RelCText>

			<RelCText>"Yes I'm from Florida and yes photography pays *some* of our bills ;) Husband got contract to work in Doha so I am thinking the expensive part of living arrangements there will all depend on what his contract stipulates. Thanks for the real estate agent contact mdobrasz; will see if we can start lining up some visits to different areas and take a look at villas vs condo... not sure what is best for us yet. I think given we are going to try to bring our 2 motorcycles a house with a garage will be best... Nic; thanks for the advice; I think we'll probably opt to be closet to airport than to drive 1 hour to get to and from work.

			<RelCText>Hi; I am not actually in Doha yet myself; arriving at the end of this month. The only vehcile imports I have done in Doha previously was for the Oilfield Market; and is done slightly differently. You might be surprised; I seen a couple of big bike shops here in Doha when I visted a few weeks back. Anyhow; in Dubai a few years ago; I imported some choppers from the guys off Discovery Channel program. The Duty was 5% of the CIF Value. (eg. Bike is US $20000 CIF then Duty will be US $1000) I then had to pay a local agent commission on the import of US $1500 each as they held the import licence agreements for the bikes. Therafter; Police Inspection; Registration and other details were approx. $1200 per bike. Then of course you will have standard insurance and road tax; which I believe is approx. $100 per month in Doha. (Someone can correct me if I am wrong) PM me if you need further information; I do work in this field and can get a colleague to check all the ins and outs if required. Have.....</RelCText>

			<RelCText>My husband is a life-long motorcycle junkie. Got his first when he was about 10 years old. He would never consider riding one here in Doha. Traffic is very dangerous. They have the highest accident rate per capita in the entire world. Check out some you-tube videos showing all the spectacular car crashes in Doha. You have to see it to believe it. Seriously most people see a car crash every single day. Riding motorcycles on the streets in Doha is only for fools in my opinion.</RelCText>

Wasta; I have but lol kat i dont have the right wasta so im out of here. even with a catchy; professional cv it all came down to wrong visa. lol and they say being American with upon arrival visa is transferable.... ya right.... Can u be my wasta? It is EASY if you are on husbands rp; just need patience as this is Qatar they move slow in HR; but they get over 100+ applications a day.

			<RelCText>its quiet; but you can find things to do if you really want to. Now..being happy will depend on a lot of things; to be honest. Are you single..do you have a very active night life...etc... I don't have a curfew..I think that might depend upon what job you have and the requirements. Active night life..there is one but its limited. I see you are from the UK..will be honest with you and say its nothing like the pub scene back there. Clubs and pubs are located ONLY in hotels. Easy to get around if you drive..but you have to be aggressive in your driving manner and defensive...;) I just like it here; for many many reasons...but you DO need to look at all the perspectives before coming here.

I; however; have been studying Arabic for a long time and am basically fluent; I'm here to perfect my language skills. If you are looking for a private tutor I am available everyday after 2pm. My Arabic is quite good and as a non-native speaker I'm very familiar with how non-natives learn the language.

			<RelCText>Salam; Hello; Bonjour; Hola &amp; Oi !! To all those who were looking for possible Arabic tutoring by a native speaker . . . I am a native speaker from Palestine. I am educated but I have tutored Arabic for non-Arabic native speakers for many years during my stay in the States; whether for Arab Americans who do not speak Arabic well or Americans; Mexicans; Brasilians; Europeans and some Asians. I set up my own notes and lessons into three different levels; Beginner; intermediate and advanced. I do so to organize things and meet certain expectations of what the student is looking for. Note to the visitors of this website -- since this posting; i will check the website daily just in case. Otherwise; if you are interested; you can email me at hamoorabi69@hotmail.com I have kept my tutoring notes that I used with students and I do use a small writing board or a big writing board with colors to make it easy on the student on how to read and how the letters are connected to gether. Plus; I make .....</RelCText>

Tomorrow halas."" :) Anyhow if you need my help in organising things; just let me know."</RelCText>

			<RelCText>just by living in Doha; you should learn English fairly quick. Here are some pointers - Speak English at home; ban any other language - Always try to use subtitles when watching TV/DVD - Only listen to English Music - Only read English books; papers etc etc Youngsters absorb language fairly quick and in my humble opinion do not need tutoring; as they will get English in school either way.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>As promised on my previous post; I'm very glad to inform you that gluten free bread can be ordered at the bakery corner of La Cigale Hotel. The pastry chef prepares white bread; pesto bread; tomato bread and thyme bread. He can also bake small sandwiches. He also offers delicious cookies. You will have to place your order one or two days in advance as this is a special preparation requesting a place and baking instruments completely free of gluten. We eat these breads since a few week and are very satisfied. Bon appetit</RelCText>

			<RelCText>You can probably order your GF bread from La Cigale by phone but I think that; the 1st time; it is better to go to the bakery counter or to the casher. Try to get a phone contact or an email for the next orders. Sorry but I may not give you the contacts I got there... The price for a 1/2 kg bread is 50 QAR. It is not cheap but compared to the bread sold in Megamarkt; it is cheap AND better. You can contact me through this email adress : gf.jodemaere@spamgourmet.com !!! this address is a disposable address and will not work anymore after a short while.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>shortening is available all over; try the oil aisles; down with the ghee. i think i bought mine in the carrefour in city centre. haven't seen bran; haven't really looked though. not sure its that readily available? try the cold cereal aisle? perhaps that explains the rather white brown bread. the rye bread i bought today must have had only 1 grain of rye as well. was delicious; but not very strong in the rye department. another ingredient that seems to be fairly rare is baking soda. can always find baking powder.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>I have started cooking from scratch which is probably healthier but its time consuming with three different diets. In the UK you can buy wheat free; milk free and lactose free products.

			<RelCText>I am suppose to be wheat intolerant but in this country I have given up and am bloated all the time. Mega mart also has wheat free flour to make your own bread; doubles up great for pizza bases; carrefore occasionally stocks wheat free nut bread. Simple treat for you to try is 1 c peanut butter; 1 c sugar; 1 egg. Mix all together; put spoonfuls on a greased tray and bake at 180 for about 20min (golden). They may come out a little soft but will harden. Good luck!   I may be blonde but I am wise smile lots laugh more</RelCText>

			<RelCText>"Megamart does have the best selection. Edensoy milk is some of the best tasting (especially vanilla). It comes fortified in some varieties. Read labels on everything. If the product is from the US; it will list CONTAINS MILK in bold letters on the bottom of the ingredients. Some poptarts are milk free (cinnamon; strawberry; and apple flavor). Be cautious with chocolate. Milk is in all Cadbury chocolate. Some dark brands are vegan. Megamart also has Soya margarine and ""Smart Balance"" butterflavored spread on occasion. My advice is to stock up when they have it! Also be careful when buying bread; as many have milk as an ingredient. I haven't found any dairy-free cheese in doha. Is the allergy just cow's milk? Can goat or sheep cheese be used? The pharmacy in City Center has chewy bears calcium vitamins if you are looking for supplements. Good luck."</RelCText>

			<RelCText>This works with any white fish fillets. It's particularly nice with parrot fish. Examine the fillets closely; and remove any scales and bones missed by the fishmonger. Fry some finely chopped onion until soft; then add crushed garlic; diced carrot and celery; with a little salt. Cover and sweat for five minutes. Add about 500mL vegetable stock and simmer until the vegetables are cooked. Remove the vegetables with a sieve; then cook the fish fillets in the simmering stock until the flesh has set (no more than 10 minutes). Serve the fish and vegetables with creamy mashed potato.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Take a whole Sherry; gutted and cleaned. Stuff the cavity with mix peppers; onions and garlic. coat the skin with thinly sliced lemon. Wrap in foil and stick it on the BBQ for 10 minutes. The fish will cook in it's own juices and the lemon stops the flesh from sticking to the foil :o) Did you Google it first?</RelCText>

			<RelCText>"It is there for a reason. Earlier; there were instances when people wrote something before checking what they had written.

			<RelCText>"yes; the reason is that when the site is slow; which happens every now and then; the preview function makes it even more annoying and slow to post a comment. I don´t think it serves to any purpose. I never bother to re-read what I type and and roll down to press submit as quickly as possible... I don´t think that the preview function will stop some people from posting BS at times....I wonder how many members ""really"" preview their comments before posting?"</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Dear Rajeeb; Trust exchange of Qatar managed by State bank of India opens NRI account from Qatar. The required documents are. Passport copy; QID and visa page copy; two photos; and INR DD on your name (DD you can take from Trust exchange itself) then Trust exchange manager will sign the documents after verified. Once he signed you have send the documents by post to your nearst branch in India. After 15- 25 days you will get passbook; chq book and ATM card and all. Hope this answer would help in your question.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>According to my experience; open NRI direct account with commercial Bank &amp; ICICI bank; this gives you current account in commercial bank; NRE account in ICICI bank &amp; if you are interested in Share/mutual fund online trading then ICICI online trading account facility is best. you can transfer money from commercial bank account to your ICICI NRE account online &amp; transfer happens in one working day. Also I would like to mention one point here that for online money transfer; Dohabank exchange rates are always better than commercial bank; so for me I have also opened a Dohabank saving account which I use for online money transfer to ICICI NRE account &amp; This transfer is also fast; most of the time one working day.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>My experience with Doha Bank-Axis bank for the past 3 years has been very satisfactory. The transfers online occur instantly most of the time and the rates offered by Doha bank are the best in here compared to all other banks and the exchange houses. The customer service by Axis bank in India ( at least in Kochi; Kerala) is excellent. I do have an SBI NRE account but I still would prefer remittances done to Axis bank as the money gets credited to Axis bank accounts much faster than to SBI accounts.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>1 - If you leave with any bank debts/credit card debts/bad checks; this will create a problem for your sponsor. In that case the sponsor might blacklist you from getting a work visa in Qatar or anywhere else in the GCC. Additionally if there are issues with the bank; they may send a collection agency after you even in your home country to recover any money that you owe. 2 - There could be problems; it depends on point 1. 3 - The bank account will technically remain active. It doesn't close down at the expiration of your RP; otherwise all Qatar residents would need to go to the bank every time they renew their RP. If you have a monthly account fee over time this will bring the account into negative balance; creating a potential problem for you and your sponsor. Leave peacefully and do the right thing by your sponsor. If you leave by going on holiday and not coming back you are only going to make a problem for yourself later.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Well I think it’s a rip off. No such thing as the best bank. I left Doha Bank because of poor customer service and went to QNB which am happy with. With QNB; you have to have a minimum of Qr 3;000 in your current account always. It’s a compulsory savings scheme. Plus; you get .25% in your savings account and if you take out a mortgage loan you pay 8.5%. Be careful; read the small prints. I don't trust banks here.</RelCText>

Ofcourse you'll hv to submit your RP (once obtained) details in a months time else they'll have to close the account So Basically you can open you account and have your ATM/Credit Card (as well as their PIN numbers) in 10 mins.The best facility i've seen in this region.The only thing i'm not happy about is their QR 5;000 average balance to be maintained.Tht is a bit too much cash to have locked.</RelCText>

			<RelQBody>We are relocating from South Africa in July and I have literally applied to all the British and American schools for my 4 years son and been refused by each of them. We have however been lucky to get a spot at ACS Doha. I know its a new school; but has anyone heard anything about it and is there confirmation of whether they follow American or British curriculum?</RelQBody>

			<RelCText>As you say; it's a new school; so it's difficult to confirm anything! I believe the buildings are not yet 100% complete ... but it's nothing for you to worry about; since the school year will only start in September.

			<RelCText>Be careful; it is one where spoiled rich children with bad habits and manners conglomerate. Because it is so overpriced and because of its location it would attract mostly these types.

I can&amp;#39;t seem to get any comprehensive information on the net. I&amp;#39;d like a pool; sauna; gym; and a climbing wall would be a big plus. Any ideas or recommendations.

			<RelCText>there are a couple of 'pure' gyms i know of SAS Gym and Gold's Gym (this one you may not know of it unless you are American) which cater for the gym freaks ... the latter gym i believe is spoofed in Dodgeball (w/ Ben Stiller and Will Farrell) However; there are a few that are health clubs which is what you are after in your description they are:- Al Dana Club Diplomatic Club Doha Club (but closing soon) and clubs in major hotels Intercon Ramada Ritz Sheraton etc plus Al Sharq Ritz Carlton opening soon and some other hotels I think most are pretty full. Prices for singles range from 3000qr to 8000qr per year appr. Do not know of any with climbing walls. Can I ask do the numerous stadiums have gyms that can be used. Also; somewhere like Aspire; can you use any of the facilities there? PLus; many housing compunds have all these facilities ... the quality depends on the compund offcourse; some are real nice such as Mirage; Al Fardan; Beverly Hills; Tbah etc some not so.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>"QUESTIONS OF LABELING (excerpt from wiki) Some who reject the label Baptist prefer to be labeled as Christians who attend Baptist churches. Also; a recent trend (most common among megachurches and those embracing the ""seeker movement"") is to eliminate ""Baptist"" from the church name; as it is perceived to be a ""barrier"" to reaching persons who have negative views of Baptists; whether they be of a different church background or none The label denomination is rejected by some because of the local autonomous governance system used by Baptist churches. Being a denomination is viewed by them as having a hierarchy that substitutes for the Roman Catholic Church. Another reason for the rejection of the label is the influence of the Restoration period on Baptist churches; which emphasized a tearing down of denominational barriers."</RelCText>

			<RelCText>At the moment most schools are shut for the Summer - there may be a few schools where the Admin staff are still in. All grades are full in most schools. Most schools have very long waiting lists - however - come September there will be places because a lot won't come back from Summer holidays and some get 1st/2nd choice - leaving gaps in waiting lists.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Places have been filled by now and waiting lists will have been updated. Schools are not back now until beginning of September (by that I mean school offices) and I am almost sure that whatever school you pick; you will be placed on the waiting list. Have a look at schools suitable to your 'requirements'; but be aware that the more waiting lists you join; the better chance you have to get a place. But first you need to get here as no school will give you a chance to even join the waiting list if you are not physically in Qatar.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>This is really late to be trying to find a place for September; try and get his name into as many schools as you're interested in ASAP - There is the ASD; DESS and Doha College which are all probably considered to be the best - but because they are good - their waiting lists can be long. Some have recommended Compass or Sherbourne as well. Do a little googling to see about facilities and contact info - then start communicating with them.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>I have been doing martial arts for avery long time; and it started with traditional martial arts like Karate/Taekwondo i got black belts in both and was teaching a kids class in texas when i was in university; but then with the new wave of Ultimate fighting and MMA i switched to Muay Thai kickboxing and Brazilian Jui Jitsu; i have trained in them for almost fice years once this year is over. I even went to thailand and trained kickboxing there in the Fiartex camp i stayed there a long time basically life was training all day. I came across Krav Maga when i first started Jui Jitsu; there was a guy teaching it in town and it got alot of hype it was very effectively advertized in the united states and it attracted many people of the age-group 21years+ ; I think the organization made most of its money selling single women a false-sense of security in that if they learnt this they could take on any person in a dark parking lot.

			<RelQBody>I have a 2 and a 7 month daughter who we intend to enter into a preschool/kindergarten so just as she won't get bored at home. I'm not thinking of the big schools like QIS or Doha School but a smaller group which has english as it's main language. Any ideas of such Kindergarten or Preschools and their contact numbers? thanks! regards; Xtian</RelQBody>

			<RelCText>There are several good nursery schools with English as the primary language around Doha. My son when he was preschool age attended Mulberry Bush and then Doha English Speaking Kindergarten. A good friend of mine owned and ran these places but I don't think she still has Mulberry Bush. DESK was good though; my son enjoyed getting out of the house and making his own friends there. It's been a few years so I don't know about any of the teachers; etc that might still be there; or if my friend Louise Al Jaidah still owns the place; but you can call and find out. Good luck!</RelCText>

			<RelCText>I would suggest that you boil the tap water and use for drinking or run the tap water through a filtration process system such as Aqua Guard or Brittanica. Agents are here in Doha who would give you a demonstration and I understand the system costs you around 2000riyals but you have the liberty to pay in installments. But I have seen the demonstration and you would see the difference what a tap water or mineral water (any brand) offers. The results are amazing and am sure that you would forget all this mineral water and opt for this system. Unfortunately I dont ahve th nos. of these filtration company agent personnel numbers. whenever I get it; I shall surely post it . cheers Bob.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>It depends on your living standard and expectation for savings. In this connection it is important to know do all allowances (specialy accomodation allowance) are included or not in this amount.

If you are western I would say you wont save much out of 20k; you would want a decent apartment / villa; good social life; weekends away. If you are the sort of person who is just coming here to work work work; then you will be able to save more.

			<RelCText>I see a lot of people have already written a reasonable answer; but keep in mind following: - about flat or car rental - depends who negotiates. If a European person or a westerner in general - forget it to find those rates. For them everything is double. - as many have mentioned - depends on lifestyle. For example one of the most difficult issues for women here - to find a normal hairdresser; beautician; etc. usually too expensive and very low quality / level of hygiene. If you go to a normal place - prices are ridiculous for what you get.</RelCText>

			<RelQSubject>Qatari Men and Western Women</RelQSubject>
			<RelQBody>Ok guys I am going to prehaps ticks someone off again but I have a question; not Sunny but me. Will a Qatari man go out with a western Christian girl; have sex with her and then move on because he think women from the west are wild and sex craved. Sunny has received quite a bit response from Qatari men who want to date her once we arrive; I even got an offer myself. But I believe it is a trap and I tell Sunny be careful.

			<RelCText>It is a very rare Qatari man that would want anything more than what you just described. It is a very rare man in Qatar that wants anything more to do with a Western girl than you just described. Meeting men here is like stepping through a minefield. 9 out of 10 of them just want sex. And they will do and say anything to get it from you. I am not bitter; I do not hate men; but I have been living in various parts of Asia for the last 2 and a half years. Trust me when I say if you do not want to get burned be VERY careful who you date. Asian opinion of Western women is not very high when it comes to sex and dating. Tell Sunny to stop advertising online for a date and come here and get the lay of the land first.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>I must tell you redcajun504 Arab youths can go to any extent to get sex; but so is men from any country. Men have always sex on mind. It is always advisable to be cautious. But why are you worrying? There is a huge expat population here; which includes Indians; Europeans; Americans and even Australians. So; it's not a problem basically. Ask Sunny to be prudent and approach the things casually; without any pre-conceived notions; though caution is utmost required. You never know you may actually get a gem of person among these Arabians. After all; many of them have married Westerners. But dohagirl as such is correct that youths here always look for sex. On my own experience I must tell you they see Russians; Lebanese and Filipinos as someone always available for sex.

			<RelCText>Life is not easy if you are a Western Woman; and the main reason a man from this part of the world would want a western woman is mainly for sex. However; please do not for one moment think that the men and women here con't have premarital relationships - they do it just not talked about and it is not caried out in the open. Due to the conservative background of the boys they will always return to their families and it would be vry difficult for them to marry outside the families would not be happy about it. I think it is much better to be very cautious out here although there are a great many handsome men and they can be very charming going through the Arab and Asian world of men they are all interested in SEX. One of the things is that being found to be together whoc ae not married can get into very deep trouble here - just a little food for thought.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Sadly this has been the case for many years. Maybe it originally stems from the days when arabs had loads of money; visited capital cities (mainly in the West) and were naturally surrounded (as they were rich) by hookers. Word spread when they returned that they had been with western women. The assumption would then be made that all Western women were loose. That is the assumption that we came to many years ago.

Its impossible to believe that the thousands of crippled shaking 70 year old Western men moving with 21 year old Asian beauties do so...because the guy was so romantic; loving and responsible that the girl fell head over heals in love with him..

			<RelQSubject>HSBC's interest Rate for Personal Loan</RelQSubject>
			<RelQBody>Dear QL members; It is very surprising that HSBC is still not reducing their personal loan interest rate while othe banks have been implementing 5.0% +1.5% loan policy as per Qatar Central Banks regulations. As far as I know; HSBC should have recalculated personal loans (back and front calculations) abiding the new QCB regulations.. Any idea on this?</RelQBody>

			<RelCText>"for banks to reduce their interest rates per QCB's circular. No ifs or buts. The QCB is the governing body of banks. Wikipedia: ""...The primary function of a central bank is to provide the nation's money supply; but more active duties include controlling interest rates (i.e.; price fixing ); and acting as a lender of last resort to the banking sector during times of financial crisis (e.g.; bailouts ). It may also have supervisory powers; intended to prevent banks and other financial institutions from reckless or fraudulent behaviour. Central banks in most developed nations are independent in that they operate under rules designed to render them free from political interference."" If your bank has not reduced its interest rates; then they fall under 'fraudalent behaviour'; which would make them liable."</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Yes!!! There was a circular was issued 4-months ago. QCB is allowing banks to charge a maximum interest of 5% per annum and it is a retroactive implementation where the loan shall be re-calculated front and back. Was planning to pay my remaining loan and I learned to know that their computation will be based on the original interest rate when loan was taken. In fact; loan agreement is based on floating rate. This new interest rate are now being implemented by other banks; except HSBC>>>>></RelCText>

			<RelCText>typically here the interest on Vehicles are almost identical with small differences no more than 1/2 percentile. On personal loans; I am not sure but banks take time before issuing them. Banking here is different from the west. when you arrive to work here your company usually has facilities with certain banks so you can only take facilities from those banks (you can open in any bank a savings account but you will not get any facilities with it). some of the larger companies can send your salary to any bank and then it is up to you to choose. Note that Vehicle loans tend to be straight forward as the bank co-owns your vehicle until you pay your loan back however; personal loans take more time (at least a couple of month where your salary is transferred regularly) before it is approved. Here; there is no credit history that you can transfer with you. it is all about where your salary gets transferred and which company is sponsoring you. Bottom line; don't bother with researching any oth.....</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Well I think it’s a rip off. No such thing as the best bank. I left Doha Bank because of poor customer service and went to QNB which am happy with. With QNB; you have to have a minimum of Qr 3;000 in your current account always. It’s a compulsory savings scheme. Plus; you get .25% in your savings account and if you take out a mortgage loan you pay 8.5%. Be careful; read the small prints. I don't trust banks here.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>CBQ with no doubt. Their range of services and their network are really convenient for customers add to this their accurate customer service. CBQ is the best bank in Qatar when it comes to a number of services like Online; call center. (I also have account in QNB and I know quite well about Doha Bank) IBQ doesn't have online service at all. Network; CBQ is the bank that has the widest presence in malls (Hyatt; Villagio; city center; lulu HM; Landmark) with all convenience this brings to customers in terms of proximity and working hours. Customer service in CBQ is better than that of QNB and Doha bank. I'm not talking about people who smile only but about their accuracy and professionalism as well. They may be less flexible than other banks but for me personally I preferred their services over all other banks (and I have dealt with many of them)</RelCText>

			<RelCText>CBQ is the best; I have accounts in QNB; Standard Chartered &amp; Doha Bank. Call center agents of CBQ are really professionals and very well trained staff. They have a excellent telephone manners. Doha bank call center very poor; I always feel like I'm not welcome to ask any questions for what else I want to know. Sometimes they need to transfer to another agent but I'm not satisfied of their answers regarding my problem. Standard Chartered bank is trying too much to be the best but I'm sorry to them they are very far from CBQ call center. They register me to receive sms if ever any transactions made from my account. Only one time I receive sms from them. QNB is one of the worst; I've issued cheques for my car loan and I have agreement with the person responsible for my cheques but still it's nothing. What's funny with this guy; he act that he type something in the computer and promise it will not happened anymore. How disgusting!. http://www.lizaqat.blogspot.com</RelCText>

			<RelQBody>Has anybody else noticed this? I bank with Doha Bank and have a personal loan. I've just realised that they have increased the interest rate by 2% sometime in the last 2-3 months without even bothering to inform me. A phonecall to the bank has proved useless as usual. I'm off to the bank now in person; lets see what happens. I'd be on the lookout if you do bank with them.</RelQBody>

			<RelCText>Just an update.... I do have a fixed rate loan apparently it means nothing to them. I should feel better that this change is across the board; 'for everybody; new and exsisting loans'(in case I felt left out; I suppose). What was really amusing was how I was told this is an International Bank (???) and keeps up with the markets hence interest rates can go up and down. I don't seem to recall them going down when the US Dollar hit rock bottom!!! Also regarding not informing me about the increase....'we have 1000's of customers we can't tell everybody!' I wish I could say they were saving the environment by not sending out letters but what's the excuse for not sending an email or text? Anyway long story short; I'm moving banks and am very glad to; good riddance to old rubbish. I do wish I could meet the people who gave them all those awards for 'Excellence in banking' etc we must not be talking about the same Doha Bank. Goodluck to all those who continue to bank with them.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Vegas... re-read the post; nothing to do with late payment; just a general across-the-board increase in interest rates. Basically the bank trying to squeeze every penny out of people (especially those who have being paying on time; because this would mean they have the money; no use trying to get money out of someone who doesn't have it)to cover any losses they may have sustained while 'playing' the markets.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>but i have heard they'd open u account only if u want to make a salary transfer... GK; u have see what exactly u want from ur bank; what's ue requirements and what's important to u? the min balance? branch near ur house? good internet/phone banking? product range (apart from standard debit and credit card stuff)? interest rate on ur savings and deposits? investment products? best customer service? nobody can really give u a proper answer if u will come and ask which bank is the best in here :o) If you're looking for a problem; you're probably gonna find one.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Hi Casanova; I'm sorry to disappoint you with this; HSBC is just like any other bank in Doha; and it's even worse because they charge for every thing. Don't be amused by this word (The World's Local Bank); they are right in it's local; but it's not universal. you can ask them about something to do with another HSBC world wide; they will tell you: sorry; there is no networks between our banks in the world; so it's just local bank. I'm telling you this; since I'm dealing with five different bank in Qatar; and HSBC was even lower level than others; it's just a big name; the only good thing about them; that they provide you parking in the main branch in Banks street. I think Doha; Almashreq; and the commercial banks are better options. Best regards</RelCText>

			<RelCText>"As a woman here in Qatar; I encountered the same problem when I moved here last year...I was told ""long sleeves and long skirts"". That is not entirely true; esp. in the summer when the heat is unbearable. Your wife can wear capris (knees do need to be covered) and short-sleeved tops as long as the neckline isn't too low. The benefit to long summer skirts is that they are actually cooler than pants. The general rule is that it shouldn't be too tight or two revealing. Also; keep in mind that they run the A/c on high everywhere; so your wife will probably want to keep a cardigan with her to wear around on top of short sleeves when she is in restaurants; malls; etc. You are arriving in October; so the weather will be fine; like spring weather in the States; very pleasant actually. Last winter it actually got quite cold here; so bring jackets and even a light-weight winter coat (or heavier if you intend to travel during winter). One other option: a number of western women do wear abayas aro....."</RelCText>

			<RelCText>surfcatgolferdude. cover up is not normal here for expatriates. covered shoulders and covered knees is not a must. Let your wife relax. Think of it here as a conservative western country. The rule is to protect herself in a way that she does not dress anything that could be very very revealing and tempting some horny guys to bother her. very trasparent trousers or shirts or blouse is not rcommended. very very short skirt is not recommended.

			<RelCText>I agree with Kelly here; for expats; its alright to wear sleeveless (well; considering the weather here now) and skirts……just don’t show more skin than usual And of course; If you don’t want to draw unnecessary looks from guys/lookers here; it is very intelligent to cover up…you will see what we mean when you set foot here… basically; everything is acceptable as long as you don't draw too much attention with what you wear..</RelCText>

			<RelCText>"Your wife can wear just about anything she wants as long as it is decent. The muslim ladies are totally covered up; cos according to Islam; the beauty of the woman is for her man only. I recommend that she wear ""normal"" clothes; this is totally acceptable for ""western ladies"". And at a club or at home anything. But when you go around to a supermarket or shopping mall I recommend she wears a little more covered up. This is not because of the Islamic point of view; but more for her own protection. Don't forget; there are a lot of men here that do not have their wives with them; and sometimes their eyes are falling out by looking around.... if you get what I mean Aisha-Taweela"</RelCText>

			<RelQBody>Any advice on where to buy maternity clothes? So far; the few malls I've looked has either a terrible selection (i.e. a selection of 3 different items) or the prices are out of control. I'm to the point of buying online and paying to ship. Any ideas? (Please; serious comments only; I'm in no mood for sarcastic;silly; male humor this morning...)</RelQBody>

			<RelCText>hi Minoush; I think you probably tried these shops already; ie; mothercare;marks and spencer; BHS; Next. Yup selection is awful; and prices are ouch. Have you tried H&amp;M? They did have many trousers; price range was 160-250Qar. The other thing to do would be to invest in good pair of basic colour trousers and get your tops stitched.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Haven't tried Mothercare at CC. I hate going there but I may have to... M&amp;S does not have a Maternity section. I don't get this... every local has at least 5 kids; plus every expat seems to be pregnant. Where do they all shop for clothes?</RelCText>

			<RelCText>I tried H&amp;M and their selection was ok. The only problem were the pants had this new fangled design where the waist is supposed to sit below your waist and it felt like my pants were about to fall down. Just too hip and cool for me. I'm old and I need mom jeans! :-) I will try BHS. I'm used to Target and discount stores. The idea of paying $80-$100 for a pair of pants that I will wear for 6 months is impossible. Checked online; shipping from Motherhood Maternity from the States is $70 for a ton of clothes. I think I will just do that.... Thanks ladies!

			<RelCText>hi Minoush; you will have to go to Mothercare at CC; because apparently all maternity wear from other MC shops are to shift to MC of CC; if not already there. You need to visit the MC inside Debenhams. The locals wear the abbaya; so a loose gown inside ( the jalabiyas; more like the house maxis) is not visible to anybody. Among Asian clothes there are many loose tops in style right now; with lycra tights; so again no problems there. Getting T's is not an issue; as long as you are okay with it hugging you tight all day. The trouser style; is the low bump style right now; and it doesnt really fall off.H&amp;M had the high waist trousers. not sure about baby shop for Maternity clothes; else you may have to try the large clothes section; like Evans; if you are looking for comfy tops. Check Giordano as well; they dont have maternity; but they usually have these loose comfy linen trousers that you can tie under the bump.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>I agree - Pretty bad - even worse if you want to buy something for work. H+M are fine if you are looking for casual but that is it. BHS does not have a maternity section (I asked in the one in Landmark) and mothercare is very expensive - perhaps order over the internet?</RelCText>

			<RelCText>just my 5 cent worth of opinion: not all the things you need; you should buy abroad just because they are more expensive in doha. i wouldnt buy a baby cot and brought it over to doha. likewise for diapers (pampers). how many packs of pampers can you buy from abroad for a good one year supply; just because they might be cheaper abroad. my opinion is you should consider buying things; which are not in Qatar; from your home country. even if you try to avoid paying more on baby stuff; you will eventually spend more on something else out here and at the same time paying less for other things too; like car and petrol.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>If you're shipping a container over from the uk then my advise would be to bring E V E R Y T H I N G and more :) It's painful to pay 3 if not 4 times as you would back home.

			<RelCText>Amadeo; Sharjah to Dubai is really just 25 minutes travel by car if there is no traffic at the National Paint area. Traffic starts from 7 to 9am and from 5 to 8pm during week days. There is a short cut to avoid traffic if the driver knows it. But I don't suggest the OP to go for Air Arabia as it has only slight difference with the air ticket rates compared with the Fly Dubai. Sometimes; FlyDubai is even cheaper (if you dont have baggage to check-in) and it is convenience to any means of transportation...you can take bus; taxi or metro.</RelCText>

			<RelQBody>I have heard that it&amp;#39;s really fun to drive from Qatar to Dubai on the weekend (obviosly if you have a 4 X 4 Drive). My question is do I need to get a visa if I want to go to Dubai if I have a Residence Permit of Qatar?</RelQBody>

			<RelCText>Although you can go to dubai and get visa on arrival if you are going by air but road travel is different. You have to pass Saudi border and you need saudi visa. In order to get saudi visa you have to get UAE visa first. Saudi gives visa only after you already have UAE visa on your passport. Hope this clarifies.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Driving to UAE is a lot cheaper than flying. You save on air fare (specially if there are more than one persons travelling) and then on taxis in UAE. Do what u think is best but it is not dangerous inside saudi. It is just a normal highway.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>If you look at older maps; there is a land route connecting qatar with UAE. What happened to it? well; one day the saudis decided they would take it over; and did so; murdering some qatari border guards in the process. http://www.arab.de/arabinfo/qatar-government.htm When I lived in Oman; the same sort of thing happened to a piece of land bordering the UAE...which is why Oman is split in two pieces.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Fly Dubai really sucks. Their airport staff seems to have no clue about Dubai immegration procedures and can easily ban any passenger from boarding. the airport counter has no supervisor to talk to; in case of any conflict and their main office staff are worse in cooperation. I had a similar situation where they did not allow me to board as my RP had only 2.5 months expiry date. I purchased a ticked on Qatar Airways and got an arrival visa at Dubai without any problem. Fly Dubai was not convinced and they seemed did not want to listen and escaped from paying back the ticket cost. I desided to use a good reputed carrier even with double or tripple ticket fare rather than facing such irresponsible situation at the last moment.</RelCText>

			<RelQSubject>Qatar Tourist Visa</RelQSubject>
			<RelQBody>Hello. Does anybody know the requirements for a Philippine citizen to get a Qatar Tourist Visa if the host will be the one to finance the trip? Do I need affidavit of support and the host's bank statement to present to the consul? I am planning to visit my fiance currently deployed in Qatar and he will be the one to sponsor the trip and the visa process. I will stay there for a week if ever granted a Qatar tourist visa. Any ideas please? Thanks.</RelQBody>

			<RelCText>h! dear As far as i know you can easily get a tourist visa easily but the difficult part is entering/passing Philippine immigration. I would suggest to ask someone from qatar to play as sponsor in behalf of ur fiancee; much better if its a woman bcoz Qatar culture doesn't tolerate such things that a guy will sponsor a girl without any immediate relation. in addition to; the Phil. immigration might ask u for additional docs like sponsor letter; bank statement; show money; married cert if your married etc. just to satisfy them that ur genuine visitor in the country. I will advice u to go to an agency so they could help u find an sponsor.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Well I think it’s a rip off. No such thing as the best bank. I left Doha Bank because of poor customer service and went to QNB which am happy with. With QNB; you have to have a minimum of Qr 3;000 in your current account always. It’s a compulsory savings scheme. Plus; you get .25% in your savings account and if you take out a mortgage loan you pay 8.5%. Be careful; read the small prints. I don't trust banks here.</RelCText>

Customer service tell me to enrol in some wafa points but both the website and contact number of wafa do not work if i wish to enrol. Awesome. QAR 500 bucks for a useless silver card - sorry platinium.</RelCText>

GK; u have see what exactly u want from ur bank; what's ue requirements and what's important to u? the min balance? branch near ur house? good internet/phone banking? product range (apart from standard debit and credit card stuff)? interest rate on ur savings and deposits? investment products? best customer service? nobody can really give u a proper answer if u will come and ask which bank is the best in here :o) If you're looking for a problem; you're probably gonna find one.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Hi Casanova; I'm sorry to disappoint you with this; HSBC is just like any other bank in Doha; and it's even worse because they charge for every thing. Don't be amused by this word (The World's Local Bank); they are right in it's local; but it's not universal. you can ask them about something to do with another HSBC world wide; they will tell you: sorry; there is no networks between our banks in the world; so it's just local bank. I'm telling you this; since I'm dealing with five different bank in Qatar; and HSBC was even lower level than others; it's just a big name; the only good thing about them; that they provide you parking in the main branch in Banks street. I think Doha; Almashreq; and the commercial banks are better options. Best regards</RelCText>

			<RelCText>CBQ with no doubt. Their range of services and their network are really convenient for customers add to this their accurate customer service. CBQ is the best bank in Qatar when it comes to a number of services like Online; call center. (I also have account in QNB and I know quite well about Doha Bank) IBQ doesn't have online service at all. Network; CBQ is the bank that has the widest presence in malls (Hyatt; Villagio; city center; lulu HM; Landmark) with all convenience this brings to customers in terms of proximity and working hours. Customer service in CBQ is better than that of QNB and Doha bank. I'm not talking about people who smile only but about their accuracy and professionalism as well. They may be less flexible than other banks but for me personally I preferred their services over all other banks (and I have dealt with many of them)</RelCText>

They have a excellent telephone manners. Doha bank call center very poor; I always feel like I'm not welcome to ask any questions for what else I want to know. Sometimes they need to transfer to another agent but I'm not satisfied of their answers regarding my problem. Standard Chartered bank is trying too much to be the best but I'm sorry to them they are very far from CBQ call center. They register me to receive sms if ever any transactions made from my account. Only one time I receive sms from them. QNB is one of the worst; I've issued cheques for my car loan and I have agreement with the person responsible for my cheques but still it's nothing.

			<RelCText>unless ur visa is not printed on passport; u can easily change a sposor (NO NEED OF NOC). Many people do not know this procedure and stick with the job. The only thing is that they may charge ur flight &amp; visa exp. from ur settlement.

I think at least 75% of your salary x years of service is your gratuity plus all your vacation leave &amp; etc; Im not sure though but most probably it's going to be like that... I have a question my self &amp; it is related here though I already posted it to questions &amp; answers but it seems no one is really visiting that part of QL so... My company got this habit of delaying people from the date of resignation so they obviously knows about the two weeks max limit of Qatar labor code's article 57. My question would be; is there a law regarding my company being liable or giving me a just compensation starting from the day I terminated my contract to the day I go back to my home country if they ""accidentally"" delays me for one or two days up?"</RelCText>

			<RelCText>every company is liable to give 21 days annual vacation and 21 days indemnity/gratuity minimum upon completion of one year. some companies to avoid this terminate the staff in 11 months. and others mostly dont pay anything to the ignorant labors and junior staff that they dont get their rights. you can approach the Human rights department and the labor department who help the expat in such cases. @ cupid-s_victim: any resignation or termination should serve a months notice except if you are terminated in your probation period (first 6 months usually). Also employees who have completed 5 years or more need to serve 2 months notice. the company is liable to pay only the notice period; the pending vacation balance if any and the indemnity calculated on the last earned basic salary. hope this helps</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Gratuity is paid @ 21 days per year which is calculated on your last basic salary. In your case u said that you are working for the last 6 years here in Qatar with a gross salary of QR.5000/month. So let us assume your date of joining is January 01; 2004 and your basic salary is QR.4000. If so; the calculation is as follows: 01.01.2004 to 31.12.2011 = 21x8 = 168 Days So your gratuity is calculated as = 4000x168x12/365 = QR.22;093.15 Apart from this; your employer should provide a ticket to your home country. The notice period up to 5 five years from the date of joining is 1 month and above that; 2 months. In your case the notice period is 2 months. Gratuity/indemnity is settled net of any staff receivables/recoveries.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>heloo2020; Chances of you getting a job there now are very slim. I don’t think you will immediately adjust to the country. It takes years when things go right; but at the moment life isn't easy there (high unemployment and huge tax loads). If you have a family to take care of; perhaps it would be wiser not to take risks when you have little chances to succeed. Take leave (don't disclose the reason to your employer) and go there to assess personally the situation. Good luck!</RelCText>

			<RelCText>i was a little hesitant whether to express my thoughts; becaue it may be discouraging statement for helooo2020. For Indians; getting a Canadaian visa is like somethig like jackpot.

			<RelCText>I have seen numerous cases of people getting Canadian visas and having no intention to work there. They base their families there and continue working in the Gulf with higher packages (because of the new passport). So; it all comes down to what your REAL intentions are. I would go with Baldricl's suggestion that you do the honourable thing and resign. perhaps you could get a commitment from your employer that he would consider taking you back in six months time if needed. Good luck anyway :)</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Thailand has two coasts and two rainy seasons. If it's dry in Phuket it's raining in Koh Samui and vice versa. If you choose the right resort hotel/location you won't get masses of tourists or the bar girl scene. I really like Thailand (going myself in three weeks) because it's so darn inexpensive. I plan to feast and sleep for next to nothing! My hotels in Bangkok and Siem Reap are about $40/night. I have stayed in the 5-star places (Peninsula; Shangri-la) but I know these little boutique places and they are just fine for my girlfriend from the US and myself. It's a chicks' holiday!

Get out of bed at a certain time; read in the hammock or another cozy place; off to some breadfast; back in the hammock; roll into the sea for snorkeling or swimming; back relaxing; go for a little walk looking at animals or plants; back relaxing... maybe a little half day excursion once in a while but nothing too long; and a simple dinner somewhere in the evening. Perfect relaxing. I definitely don't need a luxurious huge resort. Hmm.. if we decide for Thailand; can I contact you for accommodation advice?</RelCText>

			<RelCText>I went to Thailand for 3 weeks at Christmas/New Year and visited a few different places; but if you only have 5 days then you'll probably only be able to do one place. Bangkok is probably your best bet as I expect that's where you're flying to/from; and it has plenty to do for 5 days. The Lonely Planet has plenty of good suggestions of what to do; but I can give you more specific ideas if you want. We also went to Chiang Mai in the north which is lovely. Still a city with lots to see in and around it; but it seems to have a far more chilled vibe than Bangkok. If you fancy proper chilling then I'd recommend down south. We stayed on the Andaman coast at Khao Lak and Ko Lanta (north and south of Phuket respectively). Both had a nice relaxed atmosphere - not as manic as I'm led to believe Phuket is. </RelCText>

These sites usually have a great line up of hotels and their basic rates with facilities available including their pictures.

			<RelCText>I've been to Malaysia; Turkey and Paris. Paris has beautiful architecture; if u like history; museums; old buildings; night walks in the Champs Elyesse; nice cafes and such then paris is the place to go. Malaysia is fantastic! Beautiful; exotic and just amazing. U can visit Kuala Lumpur for shopping; downtown walks; nightlife and such; it's very vibrant and the diversity of people is fab. Then u've got islands such as Langkawi and Penang; which are paradise on earth. Very romantic; perfect for a honeymoon. U can relax at the beach; go sightseeing; jungle expeditions; boat rides; going to local markets; having romantic dinners; it's just great. Turkey is the cheapest; it's a mix of east and west; alot of sight seeing; alot of forests; mosques and churches are beautiful. It's a nice place. Personally; my favorite was Malaysia; and I would definitely recommend it.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>I think SALOONS usually; if they are of the 1950s barber look they offer a head massage; shave and haircut for 15-20 qr; albeit I have never had the full tratment myself so cant advise which one; there are so many anyway. What is the deal with them calling them SALOON. Did they think a SALON is for women and since they had seen (Western) films {i.e. cowboy ones) with men going into SALOONS that is the male name equivelant??? and everyone else has followed suit since. Nice man saloon; pretty saloon; and my favourite BOEUTY (something like that) SALOON; the last one would be a good name for a strpiclub cum nightclub. About massage parlours; i think most of them are men2men but there are a few exceptions check with the major hotels???</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Hi; N-M; I recently posted a similar question (http://www.qatarliving.com/node/1615). Recently I visited the Chinese Health Center and they were quite inexpensive and did a good job. They work on both male and female (separate sections; of course). From what I understand men are worked on by men; women by women. My hubbie and I are returning tonight. :) Being new here this is the only info I've scrounged up so far: Filipino Massage Center - Gents - 4550600 Hitec Massage - 4667287 International Massage Center - 4421343 Kottakkal Massage Center - 4360061 Chinese Health Center - 465-4773 Also; try the different hotels in the area - Marriott; Sheraton; etc. Good luck.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>"Thank you to both Laudgi7 and Practor. It is wonderful here to see that we have varieties of barbers to choose from : Indian; Sri lankan; Bangladeshi; Lebanese; Turkish; Philippino; etc; etc..........i guess we have to try them all to see the uniqueness of each. I guess the rest whom have had been frequenting each of these barbers can share their experiences. I heard some people said Sri lankan is the best in Head Massage; not sure though if that is true. Anyway; I tried the massage in Chinese Health Center; it is OK; can score 6.5/10. I tried both at their Main Center in D Ring Rd and the Branch in Gharrafa. The Main Center charged QR 100/hour and the Gharrafa branch charged QR 80/hour.....strange huh....for the same quality of massage. I was calling the Thai Massage Center (got their number from their ad in local newspaper)....apparently they're closed for 2 weeks....when i asked why; the guy answered the phone was telling me ""My Manager is on holiday in Thailand; so we have to close....."</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Sri Lanka is a beautiful place to visit. If you go to SriLankan Airlines office that is at Al-SAAD; you will be able to find some package for Qr 5000 (including airfare). And if you plan on going there choose July as that is the off peak season there and hotel rates are donw by at least 50%. I was there last year. The mid and south regions of SL are quite safe; unlike the North.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Why not try somewhere totally exotic in South East Asia. Thailand; Vietnam; or Malaysia caters from the 5 star to budget travellers. Air fares with Qatar Airways is approx QR3;000 to Thailand; you may find cheaper fares with Gulf Air; leaving you QR 2;000 for hotels etc. Take a look at Air Asia's web site. It is SE Asia's budget airline and can fly you cheaply and connecting you to nearby neighbouring countries and has many hotel prices listed too. If time is not an issue you can also take the bus from say Malaysia to Thailand; or Thailand to Vietnam or Cambodia. Best of luck</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Ql members are easily identifiable in a crowd. Just watch out for the following characteristics. a) The males will have long flowing beard (Look at my avatar for an idea about how it would look); which will be always unkempt and unruly. If there is a bird which has nested in his beard; that means he is the most senior among them and also the wisest. I tried to make a nest in my beard and invite a bird in; but none would touch it. I wonder why? b) b) The females will almost always have flowing; shiny; silver hair and they will have eyes lined in VIBGYOR – all colours of the rainbow. The more colours they have around their eyes; the more senior in QL they are. Age does not come in here. All of them are very young and nubile. Its very easy to find them in a crowded place because if two QL ladies get together; they will start singing “my heart will go on” at the top of their voices. c) HABITAT They are usually found near beaches and shopping malls where they go away for their hunting.....</RelCText>

			<RelCText>"The other day; i met one of the most senior members of QL - Darude. Each time he shook hands with a person; two birds came out through the two sides of his beard singing ""cuckoo; cuckoo"". I envied him. I didnt have even ONE bird in my beard while he had two. I also saw a few bisuit crumbs on his beard. I have a strong suspicion that he is using Britania bisuits to lure the birds into his beard. I have made a proposal to the birds saying that i would give them swiss chocolate biscuits if they relocated. Lets see how the negotiations go. Will have to stamp their RP's very soon so that they dont leave me anytime soon. Note to self: Give birds Residence permit; land cruiser allowance; two way tickets (even if they can fly on their own) and a free hand in doing what they will with their nest s; provided it will ALWAYS remain within MY beard!"</RelCText>

			<RelQSubject>Expat wives in Qatar</RelQSubject>
			<RelQBody>Hi everyone; Very nice to meet you all. :) My wife and I are moving to Doha in about 3 weeks. As I'm going to be working most days; my wife and I are a little concerned about what she'll be able to do to keep her occupied during the day. We were thinking of getting her enrolled at an ESL school (she doesn't speak much English). Besides take courses; what do other non-expat spouses do to keep busy? Thanks everyone. Hope to meet some of you after we arrive!</RelQBody>

			<RelCText>Hi! Nice to meet you; hope your move goes well. It can be difficult finding things to occupy your time here; especially when you're new. I'm not sure where you're going to be living? I live in an apartment block with my husband and it has no communal areas so have found it hard to meet and get to know my neighbours. I think compound life is a bit more sociable? Anyway - a couple of ideas... The Intercontinental Hotel (the one near Katara; not Intercont. the City) has a special offer on Tuesdays and Wednesdays - ladies pay only 50 QR to access their pool / pool area. I take yoga classes with Yama Yoga http://yamayogastudios.com - they are lovely and might be another way to meet people? Also; not sure what nationality / language your wife speaks but there are a number of associations for different nationalities here. Buy a copy of Marhaba magazine when you arrive - they have an up to date list of them with contact details - so she could socialise with people who speak her language.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>if she know cooking etc. she can make delicious dishes and snacks. Also she can learn many languages through online it is free. she can improve her english through online studies. If she know painting or tailoring she can earn bit extra money by doing. If she had done any beautifican course she can join in any of the parlour. If she is found animals she can give some food and water to the street cats or birds. If you need a marhaba magazine i will give you a copy. Best of Luck and a pleasant stay in qatar.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>hello! i guess it all depends on what kind of person your wife is. maybe she likes to exercise then she can go to aerobics classes n stuff.. she can do yoga or she can even go to Ezdan and get a package or sth for gym and swimming pool and stuff. and it also depends where you're stayig.. she can even sign up for a website (QL let's say) where she can learn stuff abt the country and news about the country... and she can make friends maybe. she can visit the musuems here when she comes but after some time what i metionned is pretty much all! hope she likes it here :)</RelCText>

			<RelCText>The only thing i can tell you is that someone from Guinea is miss-calling you... As far as I know there are multiple case where someone miss-calls and you call back and then your phone load is gone or you get charged a lot if you have a subscription. But as far as i know; now there are security measures in place to prevent this from happening. But that doesn't mean that they do not happen anyway :) Just be careful and don't call back. Send an email to Qtel or Vodafone and tell them about your problem. Normally they should be able to help (block the phone number from calling again). I'm not sure but i think you can also do that from your phone...</RelCText>

			<RelCText>The Ras Laffan Housing Complex in Al Khor is quite good (if that is where your staying); there is a nice beach there too.

			<RelCText>The school in Al Khor is good; well-equipped and has a happy staff. In fact everything for the expat community is well-equipped and there's a very nice club with a lot of social activities; besides lots of home-partying. Neverthless; it has a sleepy feel which can irritate and some of the teens; I gather; get a bit disgruntled. Playing the singles game might be tricky. Imagine a very orderly English suburb with no pub and a 60 minute drive to the nearest bar or off-licence; but with plenty of dance classes and bridge tournaments and stuff. Many people love it; some can't stand it.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Prices; I don't know. All the foreigners I know in Al Khor live in 'The community'; a large compound between Al Khor proper and Ras Lafan which has one school; and one social club etc. I had thought housing and club membership was provided by the various employers. It's about 40 minutes drive from the North end of Doha to al Khor. Warning! I don't live there; though I have visited and have pals there.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Hi;Canadian Luda Moving to Qatar in mid-August is a no no.But if you have no choice...Why do I say that??Because the weather is awful.But once you get to Oct-Nov. you will enjoy it. Regarding the shipment;there is no point in doing that since the company will provide you with a fully furnished appartment/villa.You will find everything here(house-holds;china;etc)at a reasonable price. Visa-it depends on how fast the company you will be working for is. What to expect when you arrive??hhhmm...difficult question.A lot of dust;heat and a lot of humidity :) I don't know how much you know about Qatar.But if you have any questions just let me know.

			<RelCText>tough time to move. I moved in August as well. but atleast you can comfort yourself in knowing you're hitting the worst weather by that time and its only positive from then on. Quick addition: I do suggest you actually move with stuff... especially if you and your partner are doing this together. clothing is expensive here and if it's just 'your own stuff' that you want around the house; pack a few boxes of clothes you want; pics; music or books or whatever. everything retail and consumable is expensive. As for a moving company.... I've used Crown Relocations on all of my last 3 moves between countries and they are top notch in every place. Visa stuff... let the employer take are of that. I can recommend that you have at minimum 2 certified and originals of all legal documents (birth certs; marriage certs; etc.)... it is easier if you need them later on than having to wait to obtain them. Plus; if you can even get one of each certified by the Qatar consulate in Canada before you go (yo.....</RelCText>

			<RelCText>It would be awesome if we had our own Hindi channel. I am a Pakistani but I love hindi movies and music. I do listen to radio 4 FM 89.1 and city FM 101.6 but we do not get them all year round. Only when the weather is calm and not windy. We don't get it all during the winter. It is a very good suggestion and I do believe Qatar should have its own 24 hour hindi FM channel.

Also there are alot of Asian Girls dating Asian Guys here; perhaps you just don't see them; trust me she is Korean and would know the numbers. Perhaps you don't notice an Asian/Asian couple but notice an Asian white match more because it sticks in your brain. I have seen loads of Fillipino Couples out together; and I am told that Fillipino girls would much rather go out with Fillipino boys here as they have more in common and are not just trated as sex objects which we know many Arab guys do.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>So to answer the question; i'm not certain if you are inquiring about Airlines policy or government visa policy.... If its the former; best thing to do is call QATAR AIRWAYS and ask them. If it's the latter; then maybe there's a government agency you can ask? When my daughter was born (here in Doha); she didn't travel till she was 6 months old; but we were told the law was that she had to have a residency Visa within a month of being born....so by the time she travelled she had it. Hope that helps somewhat; and good luck. Stay safe all. Perfection does not exist. The question therefore; is: what level of imperfection are we willing to settle for?</RelCText>

			<RelCText>for the visa; better get it before the travel to avoid furture hassles. but i would suggest that you let the baby grow old a few months more before you take him/her travelling on an airplane. just imagine even an adult do have some problms with air pressure inside the cabin of an aircraft; what more would a few weeks old or a month old baby feel about this?

No because the Syrians can tell that you have been in Israel by the entry stamp you've got at the Jordan bordercrossing. Can I travel to Israel and Syria over land useing two passport's? No because then you'll have one passport with an entry stamp from Jordan and an exit stamp in your other passport?! Offcourse the Syrians will notice that and it is also the question if Jordan want.....</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Most countries require you to have at least 6 months remaining on your passport before they will allow you to enter. I had the same problem as you whilst living in Panama. I am a resident there but with a UK passport. I was going on a 2 day business trip to Mexico and had to renew my passport before I left Panama.

			<RelCText>I dont think it is necessary to have 6 months validity while you hold a valid Residence Permit. 6 months validity of a PP is required if you are travelling to a country without having a valid visa for that country and you will not get a visa if you does not have 6 months valid Passport as well. In this case I would suggest you to renew your Passport before you go on leave as you do not have too many days left. You are planning to come back at the end of April and in case if you are not able to travel your Passport will get expired and you will be in trouble. So play safe.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>So you will be on a business visa until your RP comes through all you have to do is tell your company when you are going and they will apply for a exit visa which is just a piece of paper really saying you are allowed to go and they will also get you the entrance visa for when you come back! You can go wher you like just remember to check if you need a visa for the other countries you wish to visit!

			<RelCText>Brit; I might have to disagree with you on this one. Cost of living in home countries? I can assure you that in India; some people have a REALLY high cost of living. Like anywhere else; you can get very similar foods/item for very cheap or very expensive. Depends on how rich you are and on your lifestyle. Average living standards and governmental services vary between a 3rd world country and Europe but that is it. Plus; if someone is living here; who cares how much a soda can costs back home? Why can't that person Mr (kumar) enjoys his weekend in Qatar like Mr (John) does with his family? I bet you Mr kumar's kids and wife would like to have gourmet food every once in a while. I am glad I am white. But nothing pisses me off more than Racism and especially when it gets acknowledged by those who benefit from it! :) you know better brit.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Also BE; having worked in HR here for a while; it is common practise for companies to ask what your current salary is and they will base their offers on that. For instance; 2 Civil Engineers; one from the US and one from Philippines you will find that the one from the philppines will be on say 8000QAR and maybe the one from the states will be on 21QAR (in their home country). HR will base their offer on how much extra (or not) they can get away with offering above what they currently earn. So you can't give someone who is on 8kqar currently over 20k and similarly you cannot offer someone who is on 21k less than that because he thinks; why would I want to come here for less than I am currently earning at home. Also back to BE's point; rents; mortgages general cost of living in India and Philippines is much less than it is in most of Europe and North america. And lastly for those that say why not hire all from India etc because there is nothing more detrimental to a good company than hir.....</RelCText>

			<RelCText>what are we here for but to save for a better life when we go home. If someone cannot save for a better life when they go home; will simply not come in the first place and companies have slowly realised that hiring all from one nation does not work; so they have to pay more for a mix of people. However; what I have noticed is that people from say india who have lived in the ME a while; their salaries do start to become more equitable as they change jobs - based on their current salary and each time they change; voila; their salaries go up. What I also notice is that alot of westerners; their salaries do not change much; they were already being paid the top for what they are doing and cannot get much higher by changing jobs.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Manager's; Doctors; Accountant's; Engineers can get their visa upon arrival. In your case; I am not sure but I guess being a Finance Controller falls in the category as Accountant. I just been to Dubai recently and I got the visa upon arrival. I paid Dhs 170 for the visa with 30 days validity. Your Qatar Residence Visa should be valid still for more than 6 months to avoid any problem. Hope this tips would help you. Enjoy your stay!</RelCText>

			<RelCText>The visa on arrival fee at Dubai Airport is AED 102/-. You should purchase an Electronic card of AED 100/- from the Bank counter for which they will charge AED 102/-. There is one Visa Application form (available in front of the Bank counter) which is to be filled and submitted to the counter with your Passport and the Electronic card you bought.

			<RelCText>I would suggest that you boil the tap water and use for drinking or run the tap water through a filtration process system such as Aqua Guard or Brittanica. Agents are here in Doha who would give you a demonstration and I understand the system costs you around 2000riyals but you have the liberty to pay in installments. But I have seen the demonstration and you would see the difference what a tap water or mineral water (any brand) offers. The results are amazing and am sure that you would forget all this mineral water and opt for this system. Unfortunately I dont ahve th nos. of these filtration company agent personnel numbers. whenever I get it; I shall surely post it . cheers Bob.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>AL JAZEERA PURE DRINKING WATER is also the best. Their containers are all new. Their service staffs were polite. They have a timely deliveries so you wont worry wether you're out or still have spare containers left not consumed. They will only replenish your empty containers. No more to hurry for calling them at time you have water shortages. Besides; they are offering one(1) free standing Water Cooler dispenser for free upon your first time availment of buying 2 booklet water coupons. At a cost of QAR1100.00 for 200pcs 5-gallon bottles; it's worth more than a service and the pure healthy water. I just had availed of it two weeks ago; i have a new cooler dispenser now. Call them at TEl: 4509555 Fax: 4509444 or email them at: info@aljazeerawater.com for more queries; simply call ANWAR HUSSAIN with mobile: 6191064 for additional info.

			<RelCText>yes; Hukk is right; nestle is not good with their service. infact; i came to know that manhal and nestle belongs to the same group. manhal does the filling for nestle; no wonder why they have such lousy service. to answer Mr.Vengal; i dont agree that manhal is the best; if u r using a dispenser with their bottle; you will be surprised to see red color plastic pieces inside the water tank and at times it is visible in your glass too when you pour the water out from the faucet. thats coz the red caps what they use on their bottles are not spill proof; when u put the bottle upside down on your dispenser; the cap gets punctured and blows into pieces and it ends up in your water. i guess only rayyan and sabeel uses spill proof caps; and hence its safe.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Yes; am using a RO Water purification system close to a year and it works perfect and we feel of having a 100% purified drinking water. Need to change filter every six months. Water from tap is good to drink but due to pipeline and untidy water tanks in your apartment you might need to buy &amp; install a Panasonic water purifier which i think is more enough to purify/fitler your tap water and start use that for drinking purposes. I have the two in my house; where I came in without knowing about Panasonic being installed as part of furnished stuff. It's better you avoid drinking botttled water; they are meant for immediate needs. Good Luck! I have an article about this; let me know your e-mail ID; so to e-mail you that stuff.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>I understand; the bottled water which is meant for drinking is essentially desalinated through distillation and then processed with some mineral salts. Non-drinking water could be a mix of RO; distilled and recycled waste water. In this there could be chances of chemicals ( in very low concentations) which are meant to act as lubricants and anti-corrosion agents during reverse osmosis since these additives are not removed fully by the semi-permeable membrane. I don't know if consumption of these chemicals could be detrimental to health in the long run. Expert opinion is required.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>I'm using Al Manhal and the water sodium is medium; and the taste is not bad. Once a week delivery though unless you call (they will delivery 1-2 more depending on how low your family is). Their prices are the same as taking an empty container to the market and dragging a full one back; but delivered to your door! My roommate also uses Wataniya; which for the first month is super service; multiple times a week. Then seems to not be so super. But that could be that they changed to one to two times a week delivery and my roommate never knew (he also puts them out too late when most of the service starts 6-8am). The differences between the two is Al Manhal sometimes delivers leaking overused bottles; and Wataniya's bottles almost 100% look brand new. Wataniya's taste isn't quite as good as Al Manhal's but still not bad at all.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>if you pay in advance for whole year in Al-Massa Gym; it will cost you around QR 210 a month - whole amount is QR 2500 for a year. If you pay 6 month in advance; it will cost you something like QR 250 a month (QR 1500 got 6 months). 3 month in advance - QR 333 (QR 1000 for 3 months). Also you can check Qatar University. I just recently heard something about their Gym. They say it's cheap. But the guy who tried to tell me about it; didn't speak English; so I couldn't inderstand what is this exactly about. I am going to check it soon. If you know something about it; please also let me know. ***make money and love! no fighting; no war!!***</RelCText>

			<RelCText>there are a couple of 'pure' gyms i know of SAS Gym and Gold's Gym (this one you may not know of it unless you are American) which cater for the gym freaks ... the latter gym i believe is spoofed in Dodgeball (w/ Ben Stiller and Will Farrell) However; there are a few that are health clubs which is what you are after in your description they are:- Al Dana Club Diplomatic Club Doha Club (but closing soon) and clubs in major hotels Intercon Ramada Ritz Sheraton etc plus Al Sharq Ritz Carlton opening soon and some other hotels I think most are pretty full. Prices for singles range from 3000qr to 8000qr per year appr. Do not know of any with climbing walls. Can I ask do the numerous stadiums have gyms that can be used. Also; somewhere like Aspire; can you use any of the facilities there? PLus; many housing compunds have all these facilities ... the quality depends on the compund offcourse; some are real nice such as Mirage; Al Fardan; Beverly Hills; Tbah etc some not so.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>rambee; visit aspire and ask about their evening sports activities. bring your passport or qatar id because you need to register before you could avail of their multifacted sports activities. you pay a minimal fee monthly because aspire is subsidized by the government. some sports they have include boxing; swimming; various ball games; yoga; and others. one good thing about their evening program is that each sports class has a professional instructor dedicated not merely to teach but also to ensure student health and safety. i will go to aspire than enrol in any other chic gym here in qatar.

			<RelCText>"Just went to see how much it cost. Not that easy Im afraid. First you have to have a ""meeting"" with a marketing rep who puts you through a rigorous marketing questionaire. Then they take u on the tour of the place; and then will they only begin talking about the price. So after all that rubbish here it goes; and I shall attempt to simplify the overly confusing payment and membership options in 1 foul swoop. Silver and Gold; silver means you pay monthly 499 Qrl and another 1000 sign up and admin of around 250; plus a compulsory personal trainer session X3 (460ryl). But they insist you pay for the 12th month on sign up; obviously to ensure they get your money whether you stay the 12 mths or not. All told over 8000 ryl's for 12mnths. Now Gold; has no sign up; no admin and its only 459 ryl's a month; plus the same stupid compulsory personal trainer deal. 12mth's will be round 5900 ryl's. So either stupidly get silver and pay over 8000 or pay upfront and pay 6000. They clearly prfer u pay u....."</RelCText>

			<RelCText>how are you doing girl? well.. Al Massa charges QR1000 for 3 months as I am aware. And if you pay for the whole year; it will cost you something QR2400-2500... unless they increased the fee...I personally like Gym at the Sehati Beauty Mall; as they have the best selection of machines so far; even though it's still way too poor comparing to gyms in Canada; but at least it's better then other gyms... If you need only classes; the best choice is Aspire. BTW; i have never heard of Nero Blanco too..

			<RelCText>Not too sure what a Cisco certified Network Engineer can do for an organisation. My limited knowledge of these devices indicates to me that your work would be quite repetitiouis and mundane; requiring long hours. QR10k seems a little low to live in Qatar where basic foodstuffs are expensive and of poor quality. Personally; if I couldn't be happy with my renumeration knowing I was on a good deal; I'd go home.

			<RelCText>"Dr S; I have checked with a friend doctor at Hamad Hospital; and these are some feedbacks that I gather : 1. HMC plans to become a full fledged Specialist Hospital soon; therefore they don't take in Residents anymore. Anyway; there is an exception to this...if you're enrolling the ""Arab Board"" Program; you'll be appointed as Resident. ""Arab Board"" is a 4-year program to become Specialists. 2. To enroll the Arab Board; HMC together with Weill Cornell Medical College conducts a yearly entrance exam (normally in Sept). In the recent exam; the passing mark was 55. 3. Salary for Resident is about QR 8;200/month (excluding Housing). 4. If you have relevant experience and qualifications; you will either be appointed Clinical Associate/ Specialist/ Consultant."</RelCText>

Second; to get a job make a flyer advertising whatever it is you wish to do (tutoring; Babysitting; dog walking; whatever) and print it and take it around your compound or give to trusted friends of your parents. This is what the other teenagers I knew did and they got more then enough business.

			<RelCText>Sorry; but 3 of my friends really doesn't like and had bad experience with koala. Two of them are parents and feel something not true and saw incoherence. One of them worked there and told us the worst things we could hear. What better we can know from a worker; a person who can see more than parents ! Actually; she told me lot of exemple that what they show to the parents is completely different than what's really happen there. So for that I really do not recommend this nursery !</RelCText>

Its been a year for me as a stay home mommy and this will be same for next 6 months and then we will leave Qatar so that I can continue working. I stayed home for all this time here just so that we could stay together as a family while hubby completes his assignments here.

			<RelCText>My three-year-old boy is at Starfish Lane. He loves it; and I haven't heard any complaints from other parents. My only problem is that it's across town (near Landmark); so I have a long trip in the morning. When we arrived in Doha; we thought we were going to put Jamie into Tots Corner; which is very close to our house. It was full; and so were all of the nearby nurseries; so we went looking for a good nursery anywhere in Doha; and came across Kimberley; one of the owners. Now; I wouldn't change nursery - Jamie's settled into a routine and has his bunch of pals. -- http://all-abroad.blogspot.com/</RelCText>

			<RelCText>compu - the answer to your question is: it doesn't make any difference. it is illegal for people of different sexes who are not related (marriage / family) to share accommodation ;o) by the way... why would a woman want to live with a guy without getting married? - she's missing out on a ring and other perks that wifes get! - she still does all the work that a wife would; again... without the perks that wife would have - and finally there is this risk she'd take here... ... plus a guy will no see a reason to marry her since she's already doing the job! ha ha ha just being cheeky ;o)</RelCText>

			<RelCText>once when I was booking in with my female aunt!! I think it was because we did not have a male escort they were very being very difficult. It was not a hotel I would normally chosen to have stayed in; but there was a big conference on and I had to resort to this one. Turns out even my marriage certificate was not good enough as we got a knock on the door at 11.00pm and told to leave the hotel .. they said I did not have a ministry stamp on my marriage certificate; nor did I have a LETTER OF PERMISSION from my husband. I was so angry .... I got the man to ring my husband; but that wasn't good enough either .. this was when they said I needed the ministry's stamp on my marriage certificate!!!!!! Anyhows; my husband and I have regularly stayed in hotels in Doha. If you are going to stay in one of the 4 or 5 star ones they generally just ask you to produce your passports. I don't think they will let you book the one room knowing you are not married. If I was you; I would book in under your.....</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Yes friend you can; somebody think that she have to change her religion to muslim; that is not true ; as she is a Christian lady; she can worship the God as per Christian instructions; and Islam religion respect other religion specially christian ; so no problem at all.the verse versa is prohibited ; but if a muslim lady wants to married a christian man ; not allowed and everybody know the reason. Go ahead ; enjoy life ; and count from 1 to 10 while you ask this question: can I control my kids believing in future? what is her attitude when you get up early to prey alfajr; what type of food you will share together ; what about Ramadan fasting ....so many questions. and the most importent question : why you fail to find an Egyption lady ?

			<RelCText>There are two factors that will determine your success in quitting smoking for good. They are: 1.Will - You must have the desire to give up your habit of smoking and create a strong will to avoid a smoking relapse. 2.Mindset – You must learn about the effects of smoking; understand its consequences and face the fact that you need to stop smoking and follow; finish and maintain a quit smoking plan.

			<RelCText>My Frnd; The basic failure to quit smoking is firmness. People wants to quit smoking not because they wish; but because it is injures to health. If you really wish from your bottom of heart; then chances to quit smoking is more. But if is because someone is insisting or due to health reason; then you may really need more efforts. I wish you success. Does the QL members agree on the aove point.</RelCText>

I tried sometimes to quit but usually they are either due to my girlfriend nagging or jus trying. Usually even with success on stopping for a week; I resume again; sometimes 3 months and picked up the habit. You will have to decide and discipline yourself. Even a puff.... From what I can remember; I used a combination of sub-concious method:- 1) I do not stick with one brand of cigarette switch around also between heavy and light ones but toward light ones more. And I by when I finish...never maintain a backup pack or reach from friends.

			<RelCText>"Dear Friend; First of all let me tell you that there is nothing wihich can stop you from smoking other than your WILL TO GIVE UP SMOKING. You need to first understand what is the thing which make you smoke. 1. your mindset : It wants support! support of some kind which will give peace to your mind during tension / stress / anger etc. In case of smokers its ""smoking"" So you have to build your own support mechnism : like Music (which ever you like) any physical activiy like cycling; exercise; playing tennis ; football; swimming anything...and that u only can identify. 2. Nicotine Cycle / Levels of Nicotine in blood: This is the nicotine content in the blood which gets lowered and bue to which the necotine which is absorbed by your lungs enters into your blood through your lungs (alveolies) and carried into the blood stream through arteries to Heart and pumped to Brain through arteries. this whole process is called as Nicotine cycle.

			<RelCText>Yes! I quit 7 years ago! man... that was hard work! never again :o) After a while (I think like a few weeks) I had a horrible cough; but you just have to power through it; it goes away. Some people put on weight a little (smoking actually stops you eating... well; at least for some); but it is worth it. I can run; walk and enjoy my life now. My skin looks better; my clothes don't smell... Focus on the positives :o) side effects are just an obsticle; but you can do it. Get your family to support you - it will help.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>"Its actually surprisingly EASY if you WANT to stop smoking!! I quit after nearly 23 years of smoking when I found out that I was pregnant. Years and years of my family nagging me; bribing me; beggin me ... always the fear of the ""side effects"" if I had to quit and the hard headed insistance that I liked smoking and it was my outlet from stress and yabba yabba ... I was honestly pissed off with myself when I did stop and the truth hit home how much damage I had done to myself and to my relationships for so long and all FOR NOTHING!! There was no cold turkey; no shakes; no cough; no sudden uncontrollable energy; no sudden weight gain; etc. etc. What did happen? Anxiety and stress LEFT!! And the smell of stale smoke and the taste of it became more repulsive than ever. And I suddenly was open to socialising with people that didn't smoke! It was actually annoyingly easy to stay quit! Didn't need Zyban; nicorettes; mouth spray or anything. I had started reading Alan Carr's book ""The Easy Way....."</RelCText>

			<RelCText>I quit two years ago. Was quite tough. I used nicotine chewing gums for first few days. I still dream of smoking and feel I am just a millimeter (or a puff)away from being an addict again. Don't allow yourself even a single puff for me. Stay away from ambience which makes you feel like smoking. Quit one hundred percent. Don't give any concessions to yourself; be ruthless. Positives of quitting far outweigh the negatives. I did gain weight but reduced it as I could execise better now. Smoking anyway is outlawed almost everywhere. It's out of fashion too. I don't blame my previous generation for glorifying it as they did know less about the harms. If someone picks up the habit now or still continues with it then he or she definitely is an ignorant person. It makes you sick and smelly.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>"Ok Dr. SMOKE is in the house. Fireheartin; look before you make such a big mistake of your life stop to reconsider this whole ""giving up"". What are you going to gain by giving up smoking? Live healthier? Live longer? lol these are all myths to giving up smoking just to make you feel better about yourself. Its not easy to give up smoking depending on how long you have been smoking. Also WHY! why put your body through such mental and physical stress to resist the urge to have that beautiful puff! let me list out a few advantages of smoking 1. Taking a crap in the morning is so much more relaxed and mentally soothing when your on the throne with a ciggie. Its just comes out better. 2. Say your the only guy who doesnt smoke and all your other friends smoke; you'll be looked as that ""loser"" guy. Your not a loser when you smoke; you make MORE friends when you smoke. Imagine your Boss walks up to you one day and asks you for a light and you say ""sorry i dont smoke; i've given up smoking as it....."</RelCText>

			<RelCText>fireheartin.. smoking patches available in most pharmacies. Nothing will help you quit smoking but yourself. I was a smoker 5+ years ago.. Here are my experiences: 1- I use to smoke 1 packet a day and reduced gradually to 4 cigs a day hoping that I will break free. THIS APPROACH FAILED. 2- Tried smoking patches. It ran my throat dry and I felt like hypnotised. Bad remedy really. THIS APPROACH FAILED. 3- Determination. When I use to smoke; i leave the office to smoke and interrupt work; i make my car smelling cigarrets; it destroyed my health and i become like a dog after running for a minute or so. So I decided to stop smoking no matter what because I said to myself that all consequences and health issues that affect me from smoking have to stop. This solution WORKED!!! You have to convince yourself that you must stop. Don't fool urself thinking u r addicted and cannot stop. It is an addiction but you can live normally without it. I stopped smoking suddenly without issues. When you sto.....</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Find a good forwarder in the UK who could deliver your stuff door-to-door (that's DDP; Delivered Duty Paid for Incoterms 2000); so receiver should not worry about anything to pay as shipper will pay all the charges before it can be shipped out from the UK to Qatar.

			<RelCText>My suggestion is that if you can fit toys in with your other effects without huge expense then anything you can bring that will keep them entertained here is a good thing - and will save you time and effort trying to duplicate it all after you arrive. Actually your children probably won't want to spend much time on their bikes and skateboards during the hot summer months here; and depending on where you will be living; it might be difficult to find somewhere in your neighbourhood for them to ride around safely too. By the way; while you're packing; I would be tucking a big jar of vegemite into a spare corner (if your kids like it) as it is very hard to find here and the few 150gm jars I have ever seen here cost a bomb! Hope this helps.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>It largely depends where you will live. If you are on a compound; many kids ride their bikes &amp; skateboards inside the compounds. The electronic items; I would definitely bring because they will be much more expensive here. Good Luck with your move.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>basically the kids (12 and 8) brought a few special toys etc with them and we purchased other items ie bikes etc once we arrived. We purchased a Wii here for less than it would've cost in NZ but you have to be careful that if you bring your own PS and buy disks here that they are compatible. Likewise if you buy a new PS here that it is compatible with what is sold back in NZ; Virgin sells PAL. We didn't ship anything as we didn't know how long we would be here for and only came with suitcases and paid the excess baggage charges. Looks like we may be heading out sometime this year anyway and I'm so pleased that we didn't go the full hog and ship everything over.</RelCText>

Depending on your taste you may be ok but if for example you like really simple contemporary things you're out of luck.

You probably won't need to bring sheets either (you'll end up with a king or super king bed) *Bring books (incl kids books) there are no good bookshops here *Bring a box of bits and pieces; things like craft knife; quick-unpick; tape; tapemeasure; vivids...etc you can buy all these things here but not necc at the same shop; I bought a box of random office stuff and I'm so glad i did! *If you br.....</RelCText>

			<RelCText>If you have a generous shipping allowance; ship everything that matters to you and especially to your children. If you have special hobbies; ship any tools or items specific to that hobby - for example; quilters cannot buy batting in Qatar; or only rarely. Many children's toys are available very cheaply in Qatar; made in China; many break quickly or don't work properly. If you will live on a compound; a bike is a fun thing to have; but biking on the streets in Qatar is a hair-raising and life-threatening experience. Bring books. Bring anything that will make your life more homey and that will bring you comfort. Bring things you love but can leave behind or sell when leaving Qatar; knowing you can replace them back home. As Emma said; you can buy just about anything; but you may not like your choices. There is a lot of cheap - and ugly - stuff available; but quality is rare and may be priced two or three times higher than at home.

			<RelCText>Yes - bring as much stuff as you can for the kids. Bring shoes for yourself - sandals - shoe shopping no that great here. Go to Briscoes for super king sheets and king size single sheets. One of the most important things to get; unless you actually enjoy sleeping on a concrete slab; is a mattress topper - like a foam/latex pad to go directly on top of your matresses. I suffered for a few months before managing to find one here but it took a bit of hassle and homework first. Bring one if you can so that you have it straight away. We didn't bring a vacuum cleaner and find we don't need one; the tiled floors get swept and mopped.Lots of my daughter's dvds don;t work here - wrong zone. Our tv worked here - bring yours if want to.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>we are constantly having to order and ship things over from NZ; the UK; the US as they are not available here. We end up paying way too much in shipping charges but you just cannot get the products here of the appropriate quality and any time you are looking for something specific you can never find it as the choice is extremely limited. Just recently it was toddler car seats and only today we have ordered a wooden playpen online from NZ to ship here as we cannot find a lightweight one in Qatar. We are constantly getting our family to buy and send us baby products from NZ which we cannot get here. So definitely bring whatever you can including medicines; homeopathic remedies if you use them (as they are not available at all here); skin care treatments etc. You can always sell old toys/things once the kids grow out of them or before you leave again - particularly if they are good quality items!</RelCText>

			<RelCText>also; as other posts have recommended; bring kitchen items; crockery etc too. We did not bring our everyday dinner set and spent ages trying to find something that was dishwasher and microwave safe. We gave up as everything was too patterned and was one or the other or neither! It is the simple; basic things that are hard to come by here.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>briquettes are widely available as are a variety of makes and models of charcoal bbqs. I would say good gas grills are expensive compared to Canada; the US and Australia but are becoming more available.

			<RelCText>Bring it with you. We purchased one from Lowes and had it shipped unassembled (still in the box) and don't regret it one bit. I do recommend having a cover for it else the dust and grit will quickly work its charm. You can change the hoses and connections fairly easily once you arrive. The canisters are larger in Doha than they are in the U.S.; so don't count on the tank fitting under your grill.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>I use eBay in conjunction with Aramex for shipping. Some sellers on eBay will ship direct to Qatar as well. You will need to decide if it's wiser to spend the extra on shipping or perhaps buy locally. Aramex are a cost effective shipper from the states and the UK. When you join their Shop &amp; Ship service they give you a postal address in the USA and UK. You have you items delivered to that address; and then they forward your goods to a depot here at reasonable rates. I don't think selling items on eBay is a viable option from Qatar.

			<RelCText>Ebay is good.. two things. mind where you are buying the stuff from. if you are buying from china or Hongkong; then the seller would ship the item to Qatar with HK post which is cheap and most of the times he offers it free; but the wait time is minimum one month and 45 days is normal. you can opt to get it by HK registered post too with additional shipping cost ranging from $4 to $20; which is much faster and secure. if you are buying from other countries like US; the standard shipping is done with USPS which is no better than HK post; its take a month too; alternatively if you opt to get it shipped with UPS/DHL/FedEx from the buyer; then price for shipping ranges anywhere from $140. alternatively to buy from the US seller is Easyshop by DHL; or shop n ship by Aramex. check their website to know how they work.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Hi Mel; I guess most of the stuff that I have learned so far about AKIS and Qatar is probably the same as you. Actually finding out stuff seems difficult compared to most things on the internet. Lots of stuff seems to be out of date and this forum seems mostly full of people that struggle to put a sentence together (for whatever reason). We have found NZ to be an interesting experience but we miss our family and friends and financially we have been worse off. Food is especially expensive here; so it is good to find it cheaper there. I have been told that because the restaurants in the community are subsidised you can eat well for a couple of dollars! The school seems to have the same 'politics' issues of any school; so I guess it all depends on who you end up being mates with as to how bearable it is. Where in the UK is your husband from and what prompted the move? If you want to use email rather than this hopeless website my address is evansfamilynz@xtra.co.nz Found anyone else going .....</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Hi Andy; I will drop you an email soon. No; we don't know of anyone else going there. Did you read the forum from last year of the bunch of teachers leaving from the UK? I found that quite interesting. Do you have any kids? Will your wife be working too? Do you know what the child care options are? My husband was born in Ireland but grew up in Coventry and has been here for 4 years. We have been talking for ages about working overseas and thought we would just give it a go and see if anything came up. The Middle East sounded good from a tax free point of view and also because it was only one flight away from the UK. We plan to visit our relatives there quite often. Mel :)</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Hi Mel; yes I saw that posting about the teachers all heading out on the same flight. I imagine there are just as many this year but I guess they haven't found this thread/found this website/want to remain anonymous! We have 2 kids; both boys (13 &amp; 9); we haven't told them yet; that is a job for this holiday. Not quite sure what their reaction will be but I am sure they will be pleased to be closer to their family. We have booked flights to the UK at the end of July and will be spending 5 weeks there before getting the plane to Doha. Gill is trained as a junior teacher but hasn't done that for a while. I think she is hoping to get something in the school once we get there; I'm sure it makes more financial sense for them to employ people who are already there; we'll see. The guy I know there who is head of Geography says that because his wife is also teaching there they have found child care quite tough and have struggled with getting the home/work balance right. So I think it will make.....</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Hi Andy; Good luck telling the kids. I hope they think it is good news. I am guessing your kids will be going to AKIS? Yes; running could be interesting. Might just have to settle for the treadmill in the gym for most of the year. What did you mean that your friends have found child care tough? That is my only concern about the move over there; that the kids are going to be ok. I know there is the AKIS Nursery; would you mind asking your friend about child care for under 2 years? Enjoy the holidays in NZ! :)</RelCText>

			<RelCText>1. don't buy too famous brands. they are not offering anything extra 2. look for the best configuration that suits your needs. 3. Personally i recommend Dell; Lenovo; Acer and Asus. 4. Depending on your budget you should look for the best options. At the moment the best configurations that don't cost that much are core i5 Second Generation; 4 GB ram; 500+ GB Hard-Drive; 15.6 inch screen. The graphic card is a plus but not mandatory since i5 second generation has a pretty good integrated graphics (basically the better the CPU the better the graphics performance). So at this time i would recommend: Dell inspiron 15r: i5 SG; 500GB; 4 GB RAM; GT525M - 1GB graphic memory - this was bought by a friend of mine from sofitel with 2300QR. Something cheaper than that: Acer has some laptops that are very cheap but give very good performance. They are using some old CPU's brought back to life by the Second Generation from Intel (like Celeron). This i have right now: Acer Aspire 5349: Celeron b800 (.....</RelCText>

Downloading most of the time. 4. It's turned on even if I'm not home. 5. Turned off only when I need to restart it after an update. 6. Always relied on it to retrieve important files.

			<RelCText>listen; if your gaming is your top priority ; then u must prepare a good budget for it; i'd reccomend an alienware m15x but its a bit more expensive than laptops in carefour(they stink for gaming actualy) so buy a : 2gb ram(dont worry u dont need more than that) 2.5ghz core 2 duo proccessor nvidia 9800m gt 512 mb and dont worry about running heavy games (gow;cod4.ut3....etc) on it ;it will work at max res and highest settings.... anyways its for 8000 qr but its worth it</RelCText>

But; HP has a problem of a lil bit unstability; no; thats not the word; I dont know what it is. the thing is that although its way too fast and so advanced; I didnt feel its speed; I have the 1530 Dell (my sister's) and compared to mine and dad's; its so down in the specs and I really enjoy how fast it goes; so thats the differency; efficiency and High specs; so its ur call.

			<RelCText>All of them are actually the best that's why they made it to the market but if you will ask what are the specifications you need for certain laptop that is another thing. So think what is really your purpose in buying a laptop then you can choose among the variety of laptop based on the specifications you need and based on your purpose of having a laptop. Hope that this will give you an idea...</RelCText>

			<RelCText>"Do u remember a phrase was said in a movie .. i can't remember the movie name but it was saying ""American components; Russian components All made in taiwan"" All of the parts of these laptops are made in china now .. as we all know china is producing every thing .. The one i prefer is Fujitsu Siemens ""Made in Germany"" i like it a lot .. but also like lance12 has told u .. it depends on what is the purpose of buying a laptop .. that will let us give u the suitable specifications and u can search among the brands to find the best one and suitable price for u .. ================================================ http://www.showcaseyourmusic.com/LittleGuitarist ""Never interrupt your enemy when he is making a mistake.""

			<RelCText>Sony VAIO is the best as it is built around a Blue Ray Disk drive; one that can write 25Gb of data on a DVD. BD Drives have better visual &amp; audio capability than HD Drives. followed by Toshiba's Qosimos series. 3rd is Apple. Strangly apple does not talk about HD-drives or BD-drives!

			<RelCText>"What do you want to do with it? Everytime I buy a laptop;I ask myself : Do I need it to read memory cards? Do I need a DVD writer? Does it have Windows XP drivers? (I still don't like Vista) My rule is not to buy Sony Vaio (the keyboard reminds me of a fisher-price toy I had in the 70s) or Acer; and current specs are 2GB of RAM; 15"" screen (9-14 is too small; 17/19 too huge). Most of the other specs are standard (Wireless; Mousepad; Speakers...)."</RelCText>

			<RelCText>When you buy it; make sure the warranty is global or worldwide. Atif242; yes you don't have to pay tax when you buy the item; but tax was paid on the item when it was imported to Qatar and that is definitely passed down to you in the form of retail price.
