        <RelAText>If you have room to place the Wellingtons on the same shelf, you simply cook them in the same way as you would a single one. Conventional ovens do not work like microwaves - the amount of stuff in the oven makes no difference, providing air flow is maintained and you don't have something large right up at the top or bottom blocking an element. Fan ovens are especially useful as they actively circulate the heat around the oven cavity, so you can cook things on two different levels with fairly good consistency. </RelAText>

        <RelQBody>My question is that today I prepared Chicken Yakhni Pulao,it tasted good but it is very dry, i mean the youghurt and the masala got absorbed in the rice very much. And i have made lots of it, it is also fully cooked. So does anyone know how should i make the fully cooked pulao little juicy ? As it is difficult to eat the dry pulao(I may require another curry with it) </RelQBody>

        <RelAText>I recon it has formed like a cake after cooling. The best option you have is to take a big chunk of it in a microwaveable container (making sure that you are not breaking the rice grains) and sprinkling with some water. Then cover with a cling film and microwave for 3-4 minutes from cold. Your rice grains will separate because of the extra moisture from the sprinkled water and the Pulao will become slightly moist.   But yes, Pulao is a dry dish and needs to be eaten with a side like Raita or Salan. </RelAText>

        <RelAText>Pulao is usually a &quot;dry&quot; dish without any gravy/sauce left in it when it finishes cooking. If the rice seems to be fully cooked and the individual grains do not seem to be under cooked or slightly crunchy then I think it is probably correct.  Many people serve raita (I like a simple yoghurt-onion-tomato mix with some chili powder and salt) and green coriander chutney along with pulao or biryani which helps to make the overall experience less dry. I usually cook the marinade as well to make a gravy/salan to serve on the side when I make chicken biryani. </RelAText>

        <RelAText>Unless contaminated by, say, drinking straight out of the bottle, it will likely be safe to consume, but it will probably have deteriorated in quality. Sake which is no longer appealing to drink may be suitable for use in cooking; if you're not accustomed to cooking with sake, consider something simple, like potatoes simmered with a modest amount of water, sake, salt  pepper, soy sauce and butter. Low-alcohol beverages, whether fermented or slightly fortified, tend to deteriorate in quality over time, although they will become stale less slowly if their containers are sealed airtight and chilled. Port, marsala, sherry, vermouth, wine and sake all typically best consumed within a short time after opening, although the specific chemistry may vary. Some folks consider a sake that's been open, unrefrigerated, for more than a few weeks undrinkable. I don't know if I'm that rigid, but it's a good benchmark. I've seen certain sakes do ok for a few months in the refrigerator. </RelAText>

        <RelAText>It will keep until it doesn't. Eventually it will spoil, but because sake is considerably above the magic number for alcohol concentration to be self preserving when sealed (&gt;12.3% alcohol by volume), so long as you don't let any alcohol tolerant microbes into the bottle, then it will be fine. Smell it first,'if it smells earthy, throw it out, if it smells vinegary, you can use it but it's not rally sake anymore, it's rice wine vinegar. If you want, and if it's say half full, water it down and add a touch of cider vinegar to it. Cider vinegar isn't pasteurized so it will have live acetobacters in it and you can make your own vinegar. You need to cut the sake to half strength though otherwise it's too strong for the acetobacter to grow. </RelAText>

        <RelQBody>While proofing, the crust can appear on the dough balls if in contact with air (oxygen). I tried preventing by damp cloth but it still happens. The only thing that works 100% is plastic foil wrap, but that would prevent the dough from rising.

        <RelAText>Commercial pizza places usually use plastic dough proofing trays. They interlock and provide a relatively air-tight seal when they stack on top of each other. If you're looking for something that fits in your refrigerator, you should look into Artisan DoughMate trays. They are are 1/2 of the size of standard restaurant sized trays and you can fit a couple in your home fridge (Just under 18&quot; x 14&quot;) They stack with a very good air-tight seal and you just need a lid for the top one. You should be able to fit about six dough balls to a tray. If your only talking 2-3 dough balls then one tray would work, with a lid. But you also can look at aluminum dough pans. Some of these are also stackable with lids, and you put one dough ball into each one. I've often seen people spray the pans with oil so that the dough releases easily, or spray the dough balls so that if they spread into each other while proofing that don't make one massive dough ball. </RelAText>

        <RelAText>Try coating the dough ball with a little olive oil or a non-stick spray.  I don't know if that's the reason why but it's what I always do when baking bread and I never have a crust form during the rise. </RelAText>

        <RelAText>If you insist on using a damp cloth, you have to make it wet again and again, so this is quite cumbersome especially with long proofing times. Much easier is plastic wrap, which doesn't prevent the dough from rising if you use it to cover a sufficiently large bowl. Tightly wrapping the dough itself obviously won't work. My prefered method for these very long raises is a large food-safe plastic container with a lid. It doesn't have to be super-airtight and as I usually do a round of &quot;stretch and fold&quot; or quick punchdown every 12-24 hours I never had a problem with dried or overflowing dough.  </RelAText>

        <RelAText>If you need a larger basket to fry the amount of food you want to cook, you need more oil as well. If you don't always want to make that much food (or use that much oil) then you need a smaller vessel for deep-frying, such as a second fryer or a small wok or kadai.  If you put less oil in than the minimum it may not cover the food and/or the oil could overheat, depending on how the fryer manages its temperature settings. Overheating oil can be dangerous and will also burn your food while leaving it raw inside. All around, something to avoid.  You can save and reuse frying oil. There are some good tips at the sites below. Let it cool fully then filter out food particles (I use coffee filters and a funnel for this; it can be a slow drain, be patient) Refrigerate used oil to retard bacterial growth  Stop using it if it looks weird or smells funny! http://www.seriouseats.com/2013/09/ask-the-food-lab-how-many-times-can-i-reuse-fry-oil.html http://extension.psu.edu/food/preservation/faq/questions-and-answers-about-re-using-frying-oil http://www.epicurious.com/expert-advice/you-can-reuse-frying-oil-article </RelAText>

        <RelAText>I'd dare say a small amount of oil can work if there is ample,controlled resupply of heat - why would it make much difference if it is coming from the vessel wall or more oil. However, I found that deep friers are just not designed for that, relying on the oil fill as thermal mass a lot... even or especially the small &quot;fondue&quot; style ones*. TL;DR for the rest of post: Advice on deep frying without using a fryer. Use at your own risk. You are better off with a chip pan/wok/pot and a thermometer for the kind of job where you just want to oil-blanch an ingredient and/or want to minimise oil usage because you do not want to reuse it (eg you want to fry tofu in fresh oil because it tends to be a magnet for the worst flavors it can get from old oil, you want to deep fry something with a strongly spiced and/or unruly rub/breading/batter on it, you want to fry ingredients like carrots or red bell pepper that will discolor the oil, you want to heat the oil very high initially to account for a temperature drop). The largest plate on even a normal electric hob is around 2000W - same as a medium sized home deep fryer, and pots and pans are optimized to transfer these 2000W to what is in them.  If you are not confident with open deep frying, have someone who is work with you for a while - yes it is hazardous, but manageably so - never leave the setup unattended. especially if no food in oil, monitor thermometer closely. always have something made of metal (nothing else) in reach that can cover the pot. always assume something can boil over. keep clutter away from your work area. use really high-heat oil - peanut, refined safflower, soy, rice bran; not some unspecified compound oil with a 180°C warning. be especially careful with induction, can heat a pot with small amounts of liquid in them alarmingly quick. keep the lid off as long as you are heating. if working on gas, ask someone who has experience in doing so for additional advice (overboiling into the burner is an obvious danger!), i'm electric... *the small ones that are partially plastic in construction - never managed to set a grease fire, but I think I would be far more at a loss to control one with these things than in a pot... </RelAText>

        <RelAText>I've used two different home-kitchen deep fryers over the last 18 years or so; one of them was essentially a kettle with a hidden heating element, and the other has a removable heating element that sits under the frying basket. The early one I used, the type with the hidden heating element, really has no minimum other than the basic rule-of-thumb that want at least 3x-4x the volume of oil to food being cooked, so that the oil doesn't cool down too quickly. The basket was the other factor, but if I remember correctly, my basket got pretty close to the bottom of the pan, so that wasn't a major consideration. A more serious model that I now use, which has a feature for filtering/draining oil, a more convincing thermostat, and electronic timers, has some more serious constraints, notably a minimum oil content of about 2.5 liters, and a maximum of maybe a tad over three liters. The minimum is pretty simple to explain: If you use less than 2.5 liters, none of the food will have enough room to float above the basket. You probably won't even cover the heating element without at least a liter of oil in there. Not covering the heating element has some serious consequences, namely the risk of the element glowing and eventually over-heating (based on the thermostat probe placement), oil spatter, and the more practical one of not being able to use the basket. The maximum fill line is an approximation designed to reduce the risk of oil boil-over. Having dealt with a oil boil-over on a friteuse meant for stovetop use in my starving student days in Germany, I can tell you the consequences are unpleasant. I had scars to prove it. High water content in some foods leads to furious bubbling, and if those bubbles manage to carry oil over the side of the pan, bad things happen. </RelAText>

          <RelACText>That was my thought, too -- I've seen way too many fryers where the basket stays an inch or two above the bottom, so a good deal of the oil is more heat-sync than actually coming into contact w/ the food.</RelACText>

        <RelAText>The whole point of deep frying is to use large amounts of oil. You don't want to just coat the food. You really need to have the food swim in a mass of oil much larger than the mass of the food. Else the food will cool down the oil locally and you won't get the desired crust.  So no, as long as you are using a large basket (which holds a large amount of food), you can't do proper deep frying with a small amount of oil. A consumer style deep fryer is probably already on the low side of the correct oil/food ratio.  </RelAText>

        <RelQBody>I have a favorite tried  true recipe that I simply call ‘foil potatoes’.  recipe link: http://www.evernote.com/shard/s1/sh/048c56cc-1481-48b2-89e6-88e897da651a/b0c036a6448b07e0a486f77acf2111cb This has been made multiple times with consistently good results. A few weeks ago I decided to try substituting the same quantity of home-made  greek-style yogurt in place of the whipping cream. They did not tenderize at all and although being fully cooked, were ‘crunchy’ and not desireable. As an experiment yesterday, I did another batch with part of it done with the original recipe using whipping cream,,  the rest with yogurt. All packets were done on the same grill side-by side with exactly the same time  temp. The packets with whipping cream were done perfectly  again the ones with yogurt were tough. My internet searches have not found any answers as to why this happened. In addition to wanting to understand the science of this difference, can anyone suggest changes I can make to have this substitution work? </RelQBody>

        <RelCText>Without seeing the recipe (permissions issue - it is not a public doc) it is hard to know if something else is going on, but at a minimum, the water content in cream is significantly higher than in Greek-style (strained) yogurt. I suspect that a non-strained yogurt would probably have a similar result to your cream version. You can also &quot;reconstitute&quot; strained yogurt by mixing water or milk in to give it a thinner texture which would also probably work. I doubt it is a chemical reaction, but the recipe would help.</RelCText>

        <RelAText>The amount of grease the meat exudes is dependent upon the amount of fat in the beef. If your beef is lean (10% fat), you will not likely notice a difference in the greasiness in the final product by not straining. If your meat is fatty (ground beef in the US can contain up to 30% fat), then the final product will have noticeable grease. The fat contributes in a good way (IMO) to the flavor and mouth-feel of chili if the meat is in the 15% range.  </RelAText>

        <RelCText>Have to suspect something about your cooking practices contributes to any issues you are having with PTFE. I did finally replace my 20 year old frying pan with a new one a few years back (as much for the new, thicker aluminum part as for a new cooking surface.) I don't use the PTFE for high-heat applications it's unsuited to, and I use non-metallic utensils appropriate for not scratching up the surface. OTOH, the iron skillet I went off to college with is still going strong, but I use them for different things...</RelCText>

        <RelCText>Possibly, I have changed a few things over time. When I brown meat for the slow cooker, I now use cast iron. I've warped a few aluminum non sticks doing this because I add water to the pan to get the browning out to add to the roast. Other than that it seems that most frying pans just wont stay flat and tend to shed their coatings withing 5 or 6 years.</RelCText>

Sugar substitutes that claim that they &quot;behave&quot; the same as sugar also don't seem to react in a manner that you'd expect. I would suggest that you try a range of sugars...

        <RelQSubject>Flavor in avocadoes gone forever?</RelQSubject>
        <RelQBody>I got some made-in-store supermarket guacamole yesterday and it was a new low in bland, watery, flavorless avocado meat. I have read that the reason modern avocadoes taste bland is because they use a variety called a &quot;Hass&quot; avocado that growers prefer because it is resistant to some kinds of blight and it does not spoil as readily as other varieties. Nevertheless, as someone who remembers as a boy getting avocadoes that tasted like, well, avocadoes and actually having good guacamole, it is really discouraging the world takeover of this tasteless drone avocado called the Hass. Also, it seems the Hass itself seems to be getting more bland and more watery year by year. Is there any way to get good avocado varieties of the old type that actually taste good, or have they gone the way of the Dodo? (I should mention that I grew up in San Diego, but now live in Massachusetts so this might be part of the problem; good avocadoes might only be available locally in Southern California.) Update By some further research I have found that apparently large numbers of avocadoes are being exported by Peru, and even though they are Hass avocadoes they are reputedly MUCH more bland than California avocadoes, but also much cheaper. So, this might be the problem, I am getting Peruvian avocadoes. </RelQBody>

        <RelAText>You're exactly right in figuring out that part of the problem is having grown up with some of the world's best avocadoes, and then moving up North where decent avocadoes are scarce!  :)  Tasty avocadoes aren't all going the way of the dodo just yet, but you might have to move to Texas or Florida, or check some Mexican markets in your area, to get better avocadoes.  My husband lived in S Calif. as a child. He is an avocado connoisseur like you, as a result. Some of the best S Cali avocadoes are 'Fuerte' variety, which is more flavorful and creamier than Hass. We live in Texas and we get some very good, tasty Mexican avocadoes here- which by the way, are Hass.  But every single avocado I've brought home to hubby, whether from Mexico, Chile, Florida, Arizona, the Caribbean, Hawaii, Guatemala or Peru, ends up being compared unfavorably to those great S Calif. avocados he remembers. We visited a relative in the S Calif. area about 4.5 years ago and hubby had a delicious, fresh S Cali 'Fuerte' variety avocado during that trip--an avocado which he still recalls most fondly.  Personally I tried that same S Cali 'Fuerte' avocado too on that trip and while it was a bit tastier than the Hass avocadoes we currently get in Texas, I didn't find the flavor all THAT much better!  But hubby did prefer it a lot; he likes what he was raised on. Also his palate is more sensitive to bitterness than mine and 'Fuerte' is less bitter than Hass. In recent years, Calif. drought has made the delicious Cali avocadoes, especially the 'Fuerte', nearly impossible to get.  By the way- I lived in Illinois for a while. That state has the same avocado problem as Massachusetts: too far away from where good avocadoes and other tropical fruits are grown, to get avocadoes with decent quality. Whatever does survive the shipping journey that far North is usually picked much too green. Around the holidays such as Christmas and 16 de Septiembre and 5 de Mayo etc., there was ONE Mexican food store in Chicago that got some fresh, air-flown ripe Mexican avocadoes for sale just for these special days..at $5 each!   Mom who was raised in Texas was desperate for a good avocado because they are almost nonexistent in Chicago, so she bought 2 of those $5 avocados for Christmas dinner and said it was worth it. I had a small taste in my salad, it was great but geez $5 a piece LOL! I'm real glad we left Chicago and moved to Texas soon after that! I wouldn't count on S. California's avocado crop doing well anytime in the near future, as that area is likely to only have worse and worse water shortages and drought problems as time goes forward.  So perhaps, sadly, the 'Fuerte' avocadoes and the other delicious S Cali avocadoes you were raised on are going the way of the dodo. I hope not because they are very good avocadoes and it's always nice to be able to get USA grown tropical fruits. But unless some amazing advances in water and climate management are made to save the Cali avocado farms from extinction, your delicious S Cali grown avocadoes may become nothing more than a fond memory. </RelAText>

        <RelAText>If you have room to place the Wellingtons on the same shelf, you simply cook them in the same way as you would a single one. Conventional ovens do not work like microwaves - the amount of stuff in the oven makes no difference, providing air flow is maintained and you don't have something large right up at the top or bottom blocking an element. Fan ovens are especially useful as they actively circulate the heat around the oven cavity, so you can cook things on two different levels with fairly good consistency. </RelAText>

        <RelAText>I recon it has formed like a cake after cooling. The best option you have is to take a big chunk of it in a microwaveable container (making sure that you are not breaking the rice grains) and sprinkling with some water. Then cover with a cling film and microwave for 3-4 minutes from cold. Your rice grains will separate because of the extra moisture from the sprinkled water and the Pulao will become slightly moist.   But yes, Pulao is a dry dish and needs to be eaten with a side like Raita or Salan. </RelAText>

        <RelAText>Pulao is usually a &quot;dry&quot; dish without any gravy/sauce left in it when it finishes cooking. If the rice seems to be fully cooked and the individual grains do not seem to be under cooked or slightly crunchy then I think it is probably correct.  Many people serve raita (I like a simple yoghurt-onion-tomato mix with some chili powder and salt) and green coriander chutney along with pulao or biryani which helps to make the overall experience less dry. I usually cook the marinade as well to make a gravy/salan to serve on the side when I make chicken biryani. </RelAText>

        <RelAText>Unless contaminated by, say, drinking straight out of the bottle, it will likely be safe to consume, but it will probably have deteriorated in quality. Sake which is no longer appealing to drink may be suitable for use in cooking; if you're not accustomed to cooking with sake, consider something simple, like potatoes simmered with a modest amount of water, sake, salt  pepper, soy sauce and butter. Low-alcohol beverages, whether fermented or slightly fortified, tend to deteriorate in quality over time, although they will become stale less slowly if their containers are sealed airtight and chilled. Port, marsala, sherry, vermouth, wine and sake all typically best consumed within a short time after opening, although the specific chemistry may vary. Some folks consider a sake that's been open, unrefrigerated, for more than a few weeks undrinkable. I don't know if I'm that rigid, but it's a good benchmark. I've seen certain sakes do ok for a few months in the refrigerator. </RelAText>

        <RelAText>It will keep until it doesn't. Eventually it will spoil, but because sake is considerably above the magic number for alcohol concentration to be self preserving when sealed (&gt;12.3% alcohol by volume), so long as you don't let any alcohol tolerant microbes into the bottle, then it will be fine. Smell it first,'if it smells earthy, throw it out, if it smells vinegary, you can use it but it's not rally sake anymore, it's rice wine vinegar. If you want, and if it's say half full, water it down and add a touch of cider vinegar to it. Cider vinegar isn't pasteurized so it will have live acetobacters in it and you can make your own vinegar. You need to cut the sake to half strength though otherwise it's too strong for the acetobacter to grow. </RelAText>

        <RelAText>Commercial pizza places usually use plastic dough proofing trays. They interlock and provide a relatively air-tight seal when they stack on top of each other. If you're looking for something that fits in your refrigerator, you should look into Artisan DoughMate trays. They are are 1/2 of the size of standard restaurant sized trays and you can fit a couple in your home fridge (Just under 18&quot; x 14&quot;) They stack with a very good air-tight seal and you just need a lid for the top one. You should be able to fit about six dough balls to a tray. If your only talking 2-3 dough balls then one tray would work, with a lid. But you also can look at aluminum dough pans. Some of these are also stackable with lids, and you put one dough ball into each one. I've often seen people spray the pans with oil so that the dough releases easily, or spray the dough balls so that if they spread into each other while proofing that don't make one massive dough ball. </RelAText>

        <RelAText>Try coating the dough ball with a little olive oil or a non-stick spray.  I don't know if that's the reason why but it's what I always do when baking bread and I never have a crust form during the rise. </RelAText>

        <RelAText>If you insist on using a damp cloth, you have to make it wet again and again, so this is quite cumbersome especially with long proofing times. Much easier is plastic wrap, which doesn't prevent the dough from rising if you use it to cover a sufficiently large bowl. Tightly wrapping the dough itself obviously won't work. My prefered method for these very long raises is a large food-safe plastic container with a lid. It doesn't have to be super-airtight and as I usually do a round of &quot;stretch and fold&quot; or quick punchdown every 12-24 hours I never had a problem with dried or overflowing dough.  </RelAText>

        <RelAText>If you need a larger basket to fry the amount of food you want to cook, you need more oil as well. If you don't always want to make that much food (or use that much oil) then you need a smaller vessel for deep-frying, such as a second fryer or a small wok or kadai.  If you put less oil in than the minimum it may not cover the food and/or the oil could overheat, depending on how the fryer manages its temperature settings. Overheating oil can be dangerous and will also burn your food while leaving it raw inside. All around, something to avoid.  You can save and reuse frying oil. There are some good tips at the sites below. Let it cool fully then filter out food particles (I use coffee filters and a funnel for this; it can be a slow drain, be patient) Refrigerate used oil to retard bacterial growth  Stop using it if it looks weird or smells funny! http://www.seriouseats.com/2013/09/ask-the-food-lab-how-many-times-can-i-reuse-fry-oil.html http://extension.psu.edu/food/preservation/faq/questions-and-answers-about-re-using-frying-oil http://www.epicurious.com/expert-advice/you-can-reuse-frying-oil-article </RelAText>

        <RelAText>I'd dare say a small amount of oil can work if there is ample,controlled resupply of heat - why would it make much difference if it is coming from the vessel wall or more oil. However, I found that deep friers are just not designed for that, relying on the oil fill as thermal mass a lot... even or especially the small &quot;fondue&quot; style ones*. TL;DR for the rest of post: Advice on deep frying without using a fryer. Use at your own risk. You are better off with a chip pan/wok/pot and a thermometer for the kind of job where you just want to oil-blanch an ingredient and/or want to minimise oil usage because you do not want to reuse it (eg you want to fry tofu in fresh oil because it tends to be a magnet for the worst flavors it can get from old oil, you want to deep fry something with a strongly spiced and/or unruly rub/breading/batter on it, you want to fry ingredients like carrots or red bell pepper that will discolor the oil, you want to heat the oil very high initially to account for a temperature drop). The largest plate on even a normal electric hob is around 2000W - same as a medium sized home deep fryer, and pots and pans are optimized to transfer these 2000W to what is in them.  If you are not confident with open deep frying, have someone who is work with you for a while - yes it is hazardous, but manageably so - never leave the setup unattended. especially if no food in oil, monitor thermometer closely. always have something made of metal (nothing else) in reach that can cover the pot. always assume something can boil over. keep clutter away from your work area. use really high-heat oil - peanut, refined safflower, soy, rice bran; not some unspecified compound oil with a 180°C warning. be especially careful with induction, can heat a pot with small amounts of liquid in them alarmingly quick. keep the lid off as long as you are heating. if working on gas, ask someone who has experience in doing so for additional advice (overboiling into the burner is an obvious danger!), i'm electric... *the small ones that are partially plastic in construction - never managed to set a grease fire, but I think I would be far more at a loss to control one with these things than in a pot... </RelAText>

        <RelAText>I've used two different home-kitchen deep fryers over the last 18 years or so; one of them was essentially a kettle with a hidden heating element, and the other has a removable heating element that sits under the frying basket. The early one I used, the type with the hidden heating element, really has no minimum other than the basic rule-of-thumb that want at least 3x-4x the volume of oil to food being cooked, so that the oil doesn't cool down too quickly. The basket was the other factor, but if I remember correctly, my basket got pretty close to the bottom of the pan, so that wasn't a major consideration. A more serious model that I now use, which has a feature for filtering/draining oil, a more convincing thermostat, and electronic timers, has some more serious constraints, notably a minimum oil content of about 2.5 liters, and a maximum of maybe a tad over three liters. The minimum is pretty simple to explain: If you use less than 2.5 liters, none of the food will have enough room to float above the basket. You probably won't even cover the heating element without at least a liter of oil in there. Not covering the heating element has some serious consequences, namely the risk of the element glowing and eventually over-heating (based on the thermostat probe placement), oil spatter, and the more practical one of not being able to use the basket. The maximum fill line is an approximation designed to reduce the risk of oil boil-over. Having dealt with a oil boil-over on a friteuse meant for stovetop use in my starving student days in Germany, I can tell you the consequences are unpleasant. I had scars to prove it. High water content in some foods leads to furious bubbling, and if those bubbles manage to carry oil over the side of the pan, bad things happen. </RelAText>

          <RelACText>That was my thought, too -- I've seen way too many fryers where the basket stays an inch or two above the bottom, so a good deal of the oil is more heat-sync than actually coming into contact w/ the food.</RelACText>

        <RelAText>The whole point of deep frying is to use large amounts of oil. You don't want to just coat the food. You really need to have the food swim in a mass of oil much larger than the mass of the food. Else the food will cool down the oil locally and you won't get the desired crust.  So no, as long as you are using a large basket (which holds a large amount of food), you can't do proper deep frying with a small amount of oil. A consumer style deep fryer is probably already on the low side of the correct oil/food ratio.  </RelAText>

        <RelQBody>I have a favorite tried  true recipe that I simply call ‘foil potatoes’.  recipe link: http://www.evernote.com/shard/s1/sh/048c56cc-1481-48b2-89e6-88e897da651a/b0c036a6448b07e0a486f77acf2111cb This has been made multiple times with consistently good results. A few weeks ago I decided to try substituting the same quantity of home-made  greek-style yogurt in place of the whipping cream. They did not tenderize at all and although being fully cooked, were ‘crunchy’ and not desireable. As an experiment yesterday, I did another batch with part of it done with the original recipe using whipping cream,,  the rest with yogurt. All packets were done on the same grill side-by side with exactly the same time  temp. The packets with whipping cream were done perfectly  again the ones with yogurt were tough. My internet searches have not found any answers as to why this happened. In addition to wanting to understand the science of this difference, can anyone suggest changes I can make to have this substitution work? </RelQBody>

        <RelCText>Without seeing the recipe (permissions issue - it is not a public doc) it is hard to know if something else is going on, but at a minimum, the water content in cream is significantly higher than in Greek-style (strained) yogurt. I suspect that a non-strained yogurt would probably have a similar result to your cream version. You can also &quot;reconstitute&quot; strained yogurt by mixing water or milk in to give it a thinner texture which would also probably work. I doubt it is a chemical reaction, but the recipe would help.</RelCText>

        <RelAText>The amount of grease the meat exudes is dependent upon the amount of fat in the beef. If your beef is lean (10% fat), you will not likely notice a difference in the greasiness in the final product by not straining. If your meat is fatty (ground beef in the US can contain up to 30% fat), then the final product will have noticeable grease. The fat contributes in a good way (IMO) to the flavor and mouth-feel of chili if the meat is in the 15% range.  </RelAText>

        <RelCText>Have to suspect something about your cooking practices contributes to any issues you are having with PTFE. I did finally replace my 20 year old frying pan with a new one a few years back (as much for the new, thicker aluminum part as for a new cooking surface.) I don't use the PTFE for high-heat applications it's unsuited to, and I use non-metallic utensils appropriate for not scratching up the surface. OTOH, the iron skillet I went off to college with is still going strong, but I use them for different things...</RelCText>

        <RelCText>Possibly, I have changed a few things over time. When I brown meat for the slow cooker, I now use cast iron. I've warped a few aluminum non sticks doing this because I add water to the pan to get the browning out to add to the roast. Other than that it seems that most frying pans just wont stay flat and tend to shed their coatings withing 5 or 6 years.</RelCText>

I find that there is even a difference in using white refined cane sugar and white refined beet sugars when baking and the amount of effort of creaming eggs and sugar. Sugar substitutes that claim that they &quot;behave&quot; the same as sugar also don't seem to react in a manner that you'd expect. I would suggest that you try a range of sugars...

I have read that the reason modern avocadoes taste bland is because they use a variety called a &quot;Hass&quot; avocado that growers prefer because it is resistant to some kinds of blight and it does not spoil as readily as other varieties. Nevertheless, as someone who remembers as a boy getting avocadoes that tasted like, well, avocadoes and actually having good guacamole, it is really discouraging the world takeover of this tasteless drone avocado called the Hass. Also, it seems the Hass itself seems to be getting more bland and more watery year by year. Is there any way to get good avocado varieties of the old type that actually taste good, or have they gone the way of the Dodo? (I should mention that I grew up in San Diego, but now live in Massachusetts so this might be part of the problem; good avocadoes might only be available locally in Southern California.) Update By some further research I have found that apparently large numbers of avocadoes are being exported by Peru, and even though they are Hass avocadoes they are reputedly MUCH more bland than California avocadoes, but also much cheaper. So, this might be the problem, I am getting Peruvian avocadoes. </RelQBody>

        <RelCText>CA is in the midst of a drought. Haven't seen a good avocado from there all year. However, before the local Mexican market burned down, they were getting *Mexican grown avocados* the size of softballs that'd make your mouth water for more; cheap too!

        <RelCText>Good tropical fruit in Massachusetts is a rarity on all fronts. Picked underripe and shipped long distances does not ever compare well with picked at/near ripe from the farm up the road. Sometimes we see halfway decent Mexican or Florida avocados. Halfway decent is about as good as it gets.</RelCText>

        <RelAText>You're exactly right in figuring out that part of the problem is having grown up with some of the world's best avocadoes, and then moving up North where decent avocadoes are scarce!  :)  Tasty avocadoes aren't all going the way of the dodo just yet, but you might have to move to Texas or Florida, or check some Mexican markets in your area, to get better avocadoes.  My husband lived in S Calif. as a child. He is an avocado connoisseur like you, as a result. Some of the best S Cali avocadoes are 'Fuerte' variety, which is more flavorful and creamier than Hass. We live in Texas and we get some very good, tasty Mexican avocadoes here- which by the way, are Hass.  But every single avocado I've brought home to hubby, whether from Mexico, Chile, Florida, Arizona, the Caribbean, Hawaii, Guatemala or Peru, ends up being compared unfavorably to those great S Calif. avocados he remembers. We visited a relative in the S Calif. area about 4.5 years ago and hubby had a delicious, fresh S Cali 'Fuerte' variety avocado during that trip--an avocado which he still recalls most fondly.  Personally I tried that same S Cali 'Fuerte' avocado too on that trip and while it was a bit tastier than the Hass avocadoes we currently get in Texas, I didn't find the flavor all THAT much better!  But hubby did prefer it a lot; he likes what he was raised on. Also his palate is more sensitive to bitterness than mine and 'Fuerte' is less bitter than Hass. In recent years, Calif. drought has made the delicious Cali avocadoes, especially the 'Fuerte', nearly impossible to get.  By the way- I lived in Illinois for a while. That state has the same avocado problem as Massachusetts: too far away from where good avocadoes and other tropical fruits are grown, to get avocadoes with decent quality. Whatever does survive the shipping journey that far North is usually picked much too green. Around the holidays such as Christmas and 16 de Septiembre and 5 de Mayo etc., there was ONE Mexican food store in Chicago that got some fresh, air-flown ripe Mexican avocadoes for sale just for these special days..at $5 each!   Mom who was raised in Texas was desperate for a good avocado because they are almost nonexistent in Chicago, so she bought 2 of those $5 avocados for Christmas dinner and said it was worth it. I had a small taste in my salad, it was great but geez $5 a piece LOL! I'm real glad we left Chicago and moved to Texas soon after that! I wouldn't count on S. California's avocado crop doing well anytime in the near future, as that area is likely to only have worse and worse water shortages and drought problems as time goes forward.  So perhaps, sadly, the 'Fuerte' avocadoes and the other delicious S Cali avocadoes you were raised on are going the way of the dodo. I hope not because they are very good avocadoes and it's always nice to be able to get USA grown tropical fruits. But unless some amazing advances in water and climate management are made to save the Cali avocado farms from extinction, your delicious S Cali grown avocadoes may become nothing more than a fond memory. </RelAText>

        <RelAText>If you have room to place the Wellingtons on the same shelf, you simply cook them in the same way as you would a single one. Conventional ovens do not work like microwaves - the amount of stuff in the oven makes no difference, providing air flow is maintained and you don't have something large right up at the top or bottom blocking an element. Fan ovens are especially useful as they actively circulate the heat around the oven cavity, so you can cook things on two different levels with fairly good consistency. </RelAText>

        <RelAText>I recon it has formed like a cake after cooling. The best option you have is to take a big chunk of it in a microwaveable container (making sure that you are not breaking the rice grains) and sprinkling with some water. Then cover with a cling film and microwave for 3-4 minutes from cold. Your rice grains will separate because of the extra moisture from the sprinkled water and the Pulao will become slightly moist.   But yes, Pulao is a dry dish and needs to be eaten with a side like Raita or Salan. </RelAText>

        <RelAText>Pulao is usually a &quot;dry&quot; dish without any gravy/sauce left in it when it finishes cooking. If the rice seems to be fully cooked and the individual grains do not seem to be under cooked or slightly crunchy then I think it is probably correct.  Many people serve raita (I like a simple yoghurt-onion-tomato mix with some chili powder and salt) and green coriander chutney along with pulao or biryani which helps to make the overall experience less dry. I usually cook the marinade as well to make a gravy/salan to serve on the side when I make chicken biryani. </RelAText>

        <RelAText>Unless contaminated by, say, drinking straight out of the bottle, it will likely be safe to consume, but it will probably have deteriorated in quality. Sake which is no longer appealing to drink may be suitable for use in cooking; if you're not accustomed to cooking with sake, consider something simple, like potatoes simmered with a modest amount of water, sake, salt  pepper, soy sauce and butter. Low-alcohol beverages, whether fermented or slightly fortified, tend to deteriorate in quality over time, although they will become stale less slowly if their containers are sealed airtight and chilled. Port, marsala, sherry, vermouth, wine and sake all typically best consumed within a short time after opening, although the specific chemistry may vary. Some folks consider a sake that's been open, unrefrigerated, for more than a few weeks undrinkable. I don't know if I'm that rigid, but it's a good benchmark. I've seen certain sakes do ok for a few months in the refrigerator. </RelAText>

        <RelAText>It will keep until it doesn't. Eventually it will spoil, but because sake is considerably above the magic number for alcohol concentration to be self preserving when sealed (&gt;12.3% alcohol by volume), so long as you don't let any alcohol tolerant microbes into the bottle, then it will be fine. Smell it first,'if it smells earthy, throw it out, if it smells vinegary, you can use it but it's not rally sake anymore, it's rice wine vinegar. If you want, and if it's say half full, water it down and add a touch of cider vinegar to it. Cider vinegar isn't pasteurized so it will have live acetobacters in it and you can make your own vinegar. You need to cut the sake to half strength though otherwise it's too strong for the acetobacter to grow. </RelAText>

        <RelAText>Commercial pizza places usually use plastic dough proofing trays. They interlock and provide a relatively air-tight seal when they stack on top of each other. If you're looking for something that fits in your refrigerator, you should look into Artisan DoughMate trays. They are are 1/2 of the size of standard restaurant sized trays and you can fit a couple in your home fridge (Just under 18&quot; x 14&quot;) They stack with a very good air-tight seal and you just need a lid for the top one. You should be able to fit about six dough balls to a tray. If your only talking 2-3 dough balls then one tray would work, with a lid. But you also can look at aluminum dough pans. Some of these are also stackable with lids, and you put one dough ball into each one. I've often seen people spray the pans with oil so that the dough releases easily, or spray the dough balls so that if they spread into each other while proofing that don't make one massive dough ball. </RelAText>

        <RelAText>Try coating the dough ball with a little olive oil or a non-stick spray.  I don't know if that's the reason why but it's what I always do when baking bread and I never have a crust form during the rise. </RelAText>

        <RelAText>If you insist on using a damp cloth, you have to make it wet again and again, so this is quite cumbersome especially with long proofing times. Much easier is plastic wrap, which doesn't prevent the dough from rising if you use it to cover a sufficiently large bowl. Tightly wrapping the dough itself obviously won't work. My prefered method for these very long raises is a large food-safe plastic container with a lid. It doesn't have to be super-airtight and as I usually do a round of &quot;stretch and fold&quot; or quick punchdown every 12-24 hours I never had a problem with dried or overflowing dough.  </RelAText>

        <RelCText>If the company that puts out the fryer specifically says that 2.5 liters is required... is there a reason you think less would be OK? At the very least, we will need to know the brand and model of the one you have. There certainly may be some fryers that work with smaller amounts of oil but we can't tell you if yours is one of them if you don't tell us which fryer you have :)</RelCText>

        <RelAText>If you need a larger basket to fry the amount of food you want to cook, you need more oil as well. If you don't always want to make that much food (or use that much oil) then you need a smaller vessel for deep-frying, such as a second fryer or a small wok or kadai.  If you put less oil in than the minimum it may not cover the food and/or the oil could overheat, depending on how the fryer manages its temperature settings. Overheating oil can be dangerous and will also burn your food while leaving it raw inside. All around, something to avoid.  You can save and reuse frying oil. There are some good tips at the sites below. Let it cool fully then filter out food particles (I use coffee filters and a funnel for this; it can be a slow drain, be patient) Refrigerate used oil to retard bacterial growth  Stop using it if it looks weird or smells funny! http://www.seriouseats.com/2013/09/ask-the-food-lab-how-many-times-can-i-reuse-fry-oil.html http://extension.psu.edu/food/preservation/faq/questions-and-answers-about-re-using-frying-oil http://www.epicurious.com/expert-advice/you-can-reuse-frying-oil-article </RelAText>

        <RelAText>I'd dare say a small amount of oil can work if there is ample,controlled resupply of heat - why would it make much difference if it is coming from the vessel wall or more oil. However, I found that deep friers are just not designed for that, relying on the oil fill as thermal mass a lot... even or especially the small &quot;fondue&quot; style ones*. TL;DR for the rest of post: Advice on deep frying without using a fryer. Use at your own risk. You are better off with a chip pan/wok/pot and a thermometer for the kind of job where you just want to oil-blanch an ingredient and/or want to minimise oil usage because you do not want to reuse it (eg you want to fry tofu in fresh oil because it tends to be a magnet for the worst flavors it can get from old oil, you want to deep fry something with a strongly spiced and/or unruly rub/breading/batter on it, you want to fry ingredients like carrots or red bell pepper that will discolor the oil, you want to heat the oil very high initially to account for a temperature drop). The largest plate on even a normal electric hob is around 2000W - same as a medium sized home deep fryer, and pots and pans are optimized to transfer these 2000W to what is in them.  If you are not confident with open deep frying, have someone who is work with you for a while - yes it is hazardous, but manageably so - never leave the setup unattended. especially if no food in oil, monitor thermometer closely. always have something made of metal (nothing else) in reach that can cover the pot. always assume something can boil over. keep clutter away from your work area. use really high-heat oil - peanut, refined safflower, soy, rice bran; not some unspecified compound oil with a 180°C warning. be especially careful with induction, can heat a pot with small amounts of liquid in them alarmingly quick. keep the lid off as long as you are heating. if working on gas, ask someone who has experience in doing so for additional advice (overboiling into the burner is an obvious danger!), i'm electric... *the small ones that are partially plastic in construction - never managed to set a grease fire, but I think I would be far more at a loss to control one with these things than in a pot... </RelAText>

        <RelAText>I've used two different home-kitchen deep fryers over the last 18 years or so; one of them was essentially a kettle with a hidden heating element, and the other has a removable heating element that sits under the frying basket. The early one I used, the type with the hidden heating element, really has no minimum other than the basic rule-of-thumb that want at least 3x-4x the volume of oil to food being cooked, so that the oil doesn't cool down too quickly. The basket was the other factor, but if I remember correctly, my basket got pretty close to the bottom of the pan, so that wasn't a major consideration. A more serious model that I now use, which has a feature for filtering/draining oil, a more convincing thermostat, and electronic timers, has some more serious constraints, notably a minimum oil content of about 2.5 liters, and a maximum of maybe a tad over three liters. The minimum is pretty simple to explain: If you use less than 2.5 liters, none of the food will have enough room to float above the basket. You probably won't even cover the heating element without at least a liter of oil in there. Not covering the heating element has some serious consequences, namely the risk of the element glowing and eventually over-heating (based on the thermostat probe placement), oil spatter, and the more practical one of not being able to use the basket. The maximum fill line is an approximation designed to reduce the risk of oil boil-over. Having dealt with a oil boil-over on a friteuse meant for stovetop use in my starving student days in Germany, I can tell you the consequences are unpleasant. I had scars to prove it. High water content in some foods leads to furious bubbling, and if those bubbles manage to carry oil over the side of the pan, bad things happen. </RelAText>

          <RelACText>That was my thought, too -- I've seen way too many fryers where the basket stays an inch or two above the bottom, so a good deal of the oil is more heat-sync than actually coming into contact w/ the food.</RelACText>

        <RelAText>The whole point of deep frying is to use large amounts of oil. You don't want to just coat the food. You really need to have the food swim in a mass of oil much larger than the mass of the food. Else the food will cool down the oil locally and you won't get the desired crust.  So no, as long as you are using a large basket (which holds a large amount of food), you can't do proper deep frying with a small amount of oil. A consumer style deep fryer is probably already on the low side of the correct oil/food ratio.  </RelAText>

        <RelQBody>I have a favorite tried  true recipe that I simply call ‘foil potatoes’.  recipe link: http://www.evernote.com/shard/s1/sh/048c56cc-1481-48b2-89e6-88e897da651a/b0c036a6448b07e0a486f77acf2111cb This has been made multiple times with consistently good results. A few weeks ago I decided to try substituting the same quantity of home-made  greek-style yogurt in place of the whipping cream. They did not tenderize at all and although being fully cooked, were ‘crunchy’ and not desireable. As an experiment yesterday, I did another batch with part of it done with the original recipe using whipping cream,,  the rest with yogurt. All packets were done on the same grill side-by side with exactly the same time  temp. The packets with whipping cream were done perfectly  again the ones with yogurt were tough. My internet searches have not found any answers as to why this happened. In addition to wanting to understand the science of this difference, can anyone suggest changes I can make to have this substitution work? </RelQBody>

        <RelCText>Without seeing the recipe (permissions issue - it is not a public doc) it is hard to know if something else is going on, but at a minimum, the water content in cream is significantly higher than in Greek-style (strained) yogurt. I suspect that a non-strained yogurt would probably have a similar result to your cream version. You can also &quot;reconstitute&quot; strained yogurt by mixing water or milk in to give it a thinner texture which would also probably work. I doubt it is a chemical reaction, but the recipe would help.</RelCText>

        <RelAText>The amount of grease the meat exudes is dependent upon the amount of fat in the beef. If your beef is lean (10% fat), you will not likely notice a difference in the greasiness in the final product by not straining. If your meat is fatty (ground beef in the US can contain up to 30% fat), then the final product will have noticeable grease. The fat contributes in a good way (IMO) to the flavor and mouth-feel of chili if the meat is in the 15% range.  </RelAText>

        <RelCText>Have to suspect something about your cooking practices contributes to any issues you are having with PTFE. I did finally replace my 20 year old frying pan with a new one a few years back (as much for the new, thicker aluminum part as for a new cooking surface.) I don't use the PTFE for high-heat applications it's unsuited to, and I use non-metallic utensils appropriate for not scratching up the surface. OTOH, the iron skillet I went off to college with is still going strong, but I use them for different things...</RelCText>

        <RelCText>Possibly, I have changed a few things over time. When I brown meat for the slow cooker, I now use cast iron. I've warped a few aluminum non sticks doing this because I add water to the pan to get the browning out to add to the roast.

        <RelAText>Use maple sugar.  Things will taste better*, but cost more. *unless, of course, you are a person who does not like real maple (of whom there are a surprising number, though I cannot claim to understand that.) For ice cream/sorbet/gelato/frozen desserts, most &quot;sugar substitutes&quot; (low calorie sweeteners, etc) don't really work, as sugar plays an important structural role in how ice cream turns out. Being sugar, maple sugar (or other &quot;unrefined/less refined&quot; sugars) work fine. </RelAText>

        <RelAText>I find that the chemical and mechanical reactions between egg-white, egg-yolk and sugar is quite an delicate and complex one. I find that there is even a difference in using white refined cane sugar and white refined beet sugars when baking and the amount of effort of creaming eggs and sugar. Sugar substitutes that claim that they &quot;behave&quot; the same as sugar also don't seem to react in a manner that you'd expect. I would suggest that you try a range of sugars... The worse of them seems to be corn based sugars. The eggs just don't behave at all... </RelAText>

        <RelQSubject>Flavor in avocadoes gone forever?</RelQSubject>
        <RelQBody>I got some made-in-store supermarket guacamole yesterday and it was a new low in bland, watery, flavorless avocado meat. I have read that the reason modern avocadoes taste bland is because they use a variety called a &quot;Hass&quot; avocado that growers prefer because it is resistant to some kinds of blight and it does not spoil as readily as other varieties. Nevertheless, as someone who remembers as a boy getting avocadoes that tasted like, well, avocadoes and actually having good guacamole, it is really discouraging the world takeover of this tasteless drone avocado called the Hass. Also, it seems the Hass itself seems to be getting more bland and more watery year by year. Is there any way to get good avocado varieties of the old type that actually taste good, or have they gone the way of the Dodo? (I should mention that I grew up in San Diego, but now live in Massachusetts so this might be part of the problem; good avocadoes might only be available locally in Southern California.) Update By some further research I have found that apparently large numbers of avocadoes are being exported by Peru, and even though they are Hass avocadoes they are reputedly MUCH more bland than California avocadoes, but also much cheaper. So, this might be the problem, I am getting Peruvian avocadoes. </RelQBody>

        <RelCText>CA is in the midst of a drought. Haven't seen a good avocado from there all year.

        <RelCText>Good tropical fruit in Massachusetts is a rarity on all fronts. Picked underripe and shipped long distances does not ever compare well with picked at/near ripe from the farm up the road. Sometimes we see halfway decent Mexican or Florida avocados.

        <RelAText>You're exactly right in figuring out that part of the problem is having grown up with some of the world's best avocadoes, and then moving up North where decent avocadoes are scarce!  :)  Tasty avocadoes aren't all going the way of the dodo just yet, but you might have to move to Texas or Florida, or check some Mexican markets in your area, to get better avocadoes.  My husband lived in S Calif. as a child. He is an avocado connoisseur like you, as a result. Some of the best S Cali avocadoes are 'Fuerte' variety, which is more flavorful and creamier than Hass. We live in Texas and we get some very good, tasty Mexican avocadoes here- which by the way, are Hass.  But every single avocado I've brought home to hubby, whether from Mexico, Chile, Florida, Arizona, the Caribbean, Hawaii, Guatemala or Peru, ends up being compared unfavorably to those great S Calif. avocados he remembers. We visited a relative in the S Calif. area about 4.5 years ago and hubby had a delicious, fresh S Cali 'Fuerte' variety avocado during that trip--an avocado which he still recalls most fondly.  Personally I tried that same S Cali 'Fuerte' avocado too on that trip and while it was a bit tastier than the Hass avocadoes we currently get in Texas, I didn't find the flavor all THAT much better!  But hubby did prefer it a lot; he likes what he was raised on. Also his palate is more sensitive to bitterness than mine and 'Fuerte' is less bitter than Hass. In recent years, Calif. drought has made the delicious Cali avocadoes, especially the 'Fuerte', nearly impossible to get.  By the way- I lived in Illinois for a while. That state has the same avocado problem as Massachusetts: too far away from where good avocadoes and other tropical fruits are grown, to get avocadoes with decent quality. Whatever does survive the shipping journey that far North is usually picked much too green. Around the holidays such as Christmas and 16 de Septiembre and 5 de Mayo etc., there was ONE Mexican food store in Chicago that got some fresh, air-flown ripe Mexican avocadoes for sale just for these special days..at $5 each!   Mom who was raised in Texas was desperate for a good avocado because they are almost nonexistent in Chicago, so she bought 2 of those $5 avocados for Christmas dinner and said it was worth it. I had a small taste in my salad, it was great but geez $5 a piece LOL! I'm real glad we left Chicago and moved to Texas soon after that! I wouldn't count on S. California's avocado crop doing well anytime in the near future, as that area is likely to only have worse and worse water shortages and drought problems as time goes forward.  So perhaps, sadly, the 'Fuerte' avocadoes and the other delicious S Cali avocadoes you were raised on are going the way of the dodo. I hope not because they are very good avocadoes and it's always nice to be able to get USA grown tropical fruits. But unless some amazing advances in water and climate management are made to save the Cali avocado farms from extinction, your delicious S Cali grown avocadoes may become nothing more than a fond memory. </RelAText>

        <RelAText>If you have room to place the Wellingtons on the same shelf, you simply cook them in the same way as you would a single one. Conventional ovens do not work like microwaves - the amount of stuff in the oven makes no difference, providing air flow is maintained and you don't have something large right up at the top or bottom blocking an element. Fan ovens are especially useful as they actively circulate the heat around the oven cavity, so you can cook things on two different levels with fairly good consistency. </RelAText>

        <RelAText>I recon it has formed like a cake after cooling. The best option you have is to take a big chunk of it in a microwaveable container (making sure that you are not breaking the rice grains) and sprinkling with some water. Then cover with a cling film and microwave for 3-4 minutes from cold. Your rice grains will separate because of the extra moisture from the sprinkled water and the Pulao will become slightly moist.   But yes, Pulao is a dry dish and needs to be eaten with a side like Raita or Salan. </RelAText>

        <RelAText>Pulao is usually a &quot;dry&quot; dish without any gravy/sauce left in it when it finishes cooking. If the rice seems to be fully cooked and the individual grains do not seem to be under cooked or slightly crunchy then I think it is probably correct.  Many people serve raita (I like a simple yoghurt-onion-tomato mix with some chili powder and salt) and green coriander chutney along with pulao or biryani which helps to make the overall experience less dry. I usually cook the marinade as well to make a gravy/salan to serve on the side when I make chicken biryani. </RelAText>

        <RelAText>Unless contaminated by, say, drinking straight out of the bottle, it will likely be safe to consume, but it will probably have deteriorated in quality. Sake which is no longer appealing to drink may be suitable for use in cooking; if you're not accustomed to cooking with sake, consider something simple, like potatoes simmered with a modest amount of water, sake, salt  pepper, soy sauce and butter. Low-alcohol beverages, whether fermented or slightly fortified, tend to deteriorate in quality over time, although they will become stale less slowly if their containers are sealed airtight and chilled. Port, marsala, sherry, vermouth, wine and sake all typically best consumed within a short time after opening, although the specific chemistry may vary. Some folks consider a sake that's been open, unrefrigerated, for more than a few weeks undrinkable. I don't know if I'm that rigid, but it's a good benchmark. I've seen certain sakes do ok for a few months in the refrigerator. </RelAText>

        <RelAText>It will keep until it doesn't. Eventually it will spoil, but because sake is considerably above the magic number for alcohol concentration to be self preserving when sealed (&gt;12.3% alcohol by volume), so long as you don't let any alcohol tolerant microbes into the bottle, then it will be fine. Smell it first,'if it smells earthy, throw it out, if it smells vinegary, you can use it but it's not rally sake anymore, it's rice wine vinegar. If you want, and if it's say half full, water it down and add a touch of cider vinegar to it. Cider vinegar isn't pasteurized so it will have live acetobacters in it and you can make your own vinegar. You need to cut the sake to half strength though otherwise it's too strong for the acetobacter to grow. </RelAText>

        <RelAText>Commercial pizza places usually use plastic dough proofing trays. They interlock and provide a relatively air-tight seal when they stack on top of each other. If you're looking for something that fits in your refrigerator, you should look into Artisan DoughMate trays. They are are 1/2 of the size of standard restaurant sized trays and you can fit a couple in your home fridge (Just under 18&quot; x 14&quot;) They stack with a very good air-tight seal and you just need a lid for the top one. You should be able to fit about six dough balls to a tray. If your only talking 2-3 dough balls then one tray would work, with a lid. But you also can look at aluminum dough pans. Some of these are also stackable with lids, and you put one dough ball into each one. I've often seen people spray the pans with oil so that the dough releases easily, or spray the dough balls so that if they spread into each other while proofing that don't make one massive dough ball. </RelAText>

        <RelAText>If you insist on using a damp cloth, you have to make it wet again and again, so this is quite cumbersome especially with long proofing times. Much easier is plastic wrap, which doesn't prevent the dough from rising if you use it to cover a sufficiently large bowl. Tightly wrapping the dough itself obviously won't work. My prefered method for these very long raises is a large food-safe plastic container with a lid. It doesn't have to be super-airtight and as I usually do a round of &quot;stretch and fold&quot; or quick punchdown every 12-24 hours I never had a problem with dried or overflowing dough.  </RelAText>

        <RelCText>If the company that puts out the fryer specifically says that 2.5 liters is required... is there a reason you think less would be OK? At the very least, we will need to know the brand and model of the one you have.

        <RelAText>If you need a larger basket to fry the amount of food you want to cook, you need more oil as well. If you don't always want to make that much food (or use that much oil) then you need a smaller vessel for deep-frying, such as a second fryer or a small wok or kadai.  If you put less oil in than the minimum it may not cover the food and/or the oil could overheat, depending on how the fryer manages its temperature settings. Overheating oil can be dangerous and will also burn your food while leaving it raw inside. All around, something to avoid.  You can save and reuse frying oil. There are some good tips at the sites below. Let it cool fully then filter out food particles (I use coffee filters and a funnel for this; it can be a slow drain, be patient) Refrigerate used oil to retard bacterial growth  Stop using it if it looks weird or smells funny! http://www.seriouseats.com/2013/09/ask-the-food-lab-how-many-times-can-i-reuse-fry-oil.html http://extension.psu.edu/food/preservation/faq/questions-and-answers-about-re-using-frying-oil http://www.epicurious.com/expert-advice/you-can-reuse-frying-oil-article </RelAText>

        <RelAText>I'd dare say a small amount of oil can work if there is ample,controlled resupply of heat - why would it make much difference if it is coming from the vessel wall or more oil. However, I found that deep friers are just not designed for that, relying on the oil fill as thermal mass a lot... even or especially the small &quot;fondue&quot; style ones*. TL;DR for the rest of post: Advice on deep frying without using a fryer. Use at your own risk. You are better off with a chip pan/wok/pot and a thermometer for the kind of job where you just want to oil-blanch an ingredient and/or want to minimise oil usage because you do not want to reuse it (eg you want to fry tofu in fresh oil because it tends to be a magnet for the worst flavors it can get from old oil, you want to deep fry something with a strongly spiced and/or unruly rub/breading/batter on it, you want to fry ingredients like carrots or red bell pepper that will discolor the oil, you want to heat the oil very high initially to account for a temperature drop). The largest plate on even a normal electric hob is around 2000W - same as a medium sized home deep fryer, and pots and pans are optimized to transfer these 2000W to what is in them.  If you are not confident with open deep frying, have someone who is work with you for a while - yes it is hazardous, but manageably so - never leave the setup unattended. especially if no food in oil, monitor thermometer closely. always have something made of metal (nothing else) in reach that can cover the pot. always assume something can boil over. keep clutter away from your work area. use really high-heat oil - peanut, refined safflower, soy, rice bran; not some unspecified compound oil with a 180°C warning. be especially careful with induction, can heat a pot with small amounts of liquid in them alarmingly quick. keep the lid off as long as you are heating. if working on gas, ask someone who has experience in doing so for additional advice (overboiling into the burner is an obvious danger!), i'm electric... *the small ones that are partially plastic in construction - never managed to set a grease fire, but I think I would be far more at a loss to control one with these things than in a pot... </RelAText>

        <RelAText>I've used two different home-kitchen deep fryers over the last 18 years or so; one of them was essentially a kettle with a hidden heating element, and the other has a removable heating element that sits under the frying basket. The early one I used, the type with the hidden heating element, really has no minimum other than the basic rule-of-thumb that want at least 3x-4x the volume of oil to food being cooked, so that the oil doesn't cool down too quickly. The basket was the other factor, but if I remember correctly, my basket got pretty close to the bottom of the pan, so that wasn't a major consideration. A more serious model that I now use, which has a feature for filtering/draining oil, a more convincing thermostat, and electronic timers, has some more serious constraints, notably a minimum oil content of about 2.5 liters, and a maximum of maybe a tad over three liters. The minimum is pretty simple to explain: If you use less than 2.5 liters, none of the food will have enough room to float above the basket. You probably won't even cover the heating element without at least a liter of oil in there. Not covering the heating element has some serious consequences, namely the risk of the element glowing and eventually over-heating (based on the thermostat probe placement), oil spatter, and the more practical one of not being able to use the basket. The maximum fill line is an approximation designed to reduce the risk of oil boil-over. Having dealt with a oil boil-over on a friteuse meant for stovetop use in my starving student days in Germany, I can tell you the consequences are unpleasant. I had scars to prove it. High water content in some foods leads to furious bubbling, and if those bubbles manage to carry oil over the side of the pan, bad things happen. </RelAText>

          <RelACText>That was my thought, too -- I've seen way too many fryers where the basket stays an inch or two above the bottom, so a good deal of the oil is more heat-sync than actually coming into contact w/ the food.</RelACText>

        <RelAText>The whole point of deep frying is to use large amounts of oil. You don't want to just coat the food. You really need to have the food swim in a mass of oil much larger than the mass of the food. Else the food will cool down the oil locally and you won't get the desired crust.  So no, as long as you are using a large basket (which holds a large amount of food), you can't do proper deep frying with a small amount of oil. A consumer style deep fryer is probably already on the low side of the correct oil/food ratio.  </RelAText>

A few weeks ago I decided to try substituting the same quantity of home-made  greek-style yogurt in place of the whipping cream. They did not tenderize at all and although being fully cooked, were ‘crunchy’ and not desireable. As an experiment yesterday, I did another batch with part of it done with the original recipe using whipping cream,,  the rest with yogurt. All packets were done on the same grill side-by side with exactly the same time  temp. The packets with whipping cream were done perfectly  again the ones with yogurt were tough. My internet searches have not found any answers as to why this happened. In addition to wanting to understand the science of this difference, can anyone suggest changes I can make to have this substitution work? </RelQBody>

        <RelCText>Without seeing the recipe (permissions issue - it is not a public doc) it is hard to know if something else is going on, but at a minimum, the water content in cream is significantly higher than in Greek-style (strained) yogurt. I suspect that a non-strained yogurt would probably have a similar result to your cream version. You can also &quot;reconstitute&quot; strained yogurt by mixing water or milk in to give it a thinner texture which would also probably work. I doubt it is a chemical reaction, but the recipe would help.</RelCText>

        <RelAText>The amount of grease the meat exudes is dependent upon the amount of fat in the beef. If your beef is lean (10% fat), you will not likely notice a difference in the greasiness in the final product by not straining. If your meat is fatty (ground beef in the US can contain up to 30% fat), then the final product will have noticeable grease. The fat contributes in a good way (IMO) to the flavor and mouth-feel of chili if the meat is in the 15% range.  </RelAText>

We recently bought a bunch of &quot;high quality&quot;, expensive, porcelain lined aluminum cookwares with enamel coated exteriors. I love the nonstick, easy cleaning so far. They are about 6 months old and no issues. Just wondering what others think of Porcelain vs Teflon cookware. Hope this will last much longer than what I've been use to.  </RelQBody>

        <RelCText>Have to suspect something about your cooking practices contributes to any issues you are having with PTFE. I did finally replace my 20 year old frying pan with a new one a few years back (as much for the new, thicker aluminum part as for a new cooking surface.) I don't use the PTFE for high-heat applications it's unsuited to, and I use non-metallic utensils appropriate for not scratching up the surface. OTOH, the iron skillet I went off to college with is still going strong, but I use them for different things...</RelCText>

        <RelCText>Possibly, I have changed a few things over time. When I brown meat for the slow cooker, I now use cast iron. I've warped a few aluminum non sticks doing this because I add water to the pan to get the browning out to add to the roast. Other than that it seems that most frying pans just wont stay flat and tend to shed their coatings withing 5 or 6 years.</RelCText>

For ice cream/sorbet/gelato/frozen desserts, most &quot;sugar substitutes&quot; (low calorie sweeteners, etc) don't really work, as sugar plays an important structural role in how ice cream turns out.

        <RelAText>I find that the chemical and mechanical reactions between egg-white, egg-yolk and sugar is quite an delicate and complex one. I find that there is even a difference in using white refined cane sugar and white refined beet sugars when baking and the amount of effort of creaming eggs and sugar. Sugar substitutes that claim that they &quot;behave&quot; the same as sugar also don't seem to react in a manner that you'd expect. I would suggest that you try a range of sugars... The worse of them seems to be corn based sugars. The eggs just don't behave at all... </RelAText>

        <RelQSubject>Flavor in avocadoes gone forever?</RelQSubject>
        <RelQBody>I got some made-in-store supermarket guacamole yesterday and it was a new low in bland, watery, flavorless avocado meat. I have read that the reason modern avocadoes taste bland is because they use a variety called a &quot;Hass&quot; avocado that growers prefer because it is resistant to some kinds of blight and it does not spoil as readily as other varieties. Nevertheless, as someone who remembers as a boy getting avocadoes that tasted like, well, avocadoes and actually having good guacamole, it is really discouraging the world takeover of this tasteless drone avocado called the Hass. Also, it seems the Hass itself seems to be getting more bland and more watery year by year. Is there any way to get good avocado varieties of the old type that actually taste good, or have they gone the way of the Dodo? (I should mention that I grew up in San Diego, but now live in Massachusetts so this might be part of the problem; good avocadoes might only be available locally in Southern California.) Update By some further research I have found that apparently large numbers of avocadoes are being exported by Peru, and even though they are Hass avocadoes they are reputedly MUCH more bland than California avocadoes, but also much cheaper. So, this might be the problem, I am getting Peruvian avocadoes. </RelQBody>

        <RelCText>CA is in the midst of a drought. Haven't seen a good avocado from there all year.

        <RelCText>Good tropical fruit in Massachusetts is a rarity on all fronts.

        <RelAText>You're exactly right in figuring out that part of the problem is having grown up with some of the world's best avocadoes, and then moving up North where decent avocadoes are scarce!  :)  Tasty avocadoes aren't all going the way of the dodo just yet, but you might have to move to Texas or Florida, or check some Mexican markets in your area, to get better avocadoes.  My husband lived in S Calif. as a child. He is an avocado connoisseur like you, as a result. Some of the best S Cali avocadoes are 'Fuerte' variety, which is more flavorful and creamier than Hass. We live in Texas and we get some very good, tasty Mexican avocadoes here- which by the way, are Hass.  But every single avocado I've brought home to hubby, whether from Mexico, Chile, Florida, Arizona, the Caribbean, Hawaii, Guatemala or Peru, ends up being compared unfavorably to those great S Calif. avocados he remembers. We visited a relative in the S Calif. area about 4.5 years ago and hubby had a delicious, fresh S Cali 'Fuerte' variety avocado during that trip--an avocado which he still recalls most fondly.  Personally I tried that same S Cali 'Fuerte' avocado too on that trip and while it was a bit tastier than the Hass avocadoes we currently get in Texas, I didn't find the flavor all THAT much better!  But hubby did prefer it a lot; he likes what he was raised on. Also his palate is more sensitive to bitterness than mine and 'Fuerte' is less bitter than Hass. In recent years, Calif. drought has made the delicious Cali avocadoes, especially the 'Fuerte', nearly impossible to get.  By the way- I lived in Illinois for a while. That state has the same avocado problem as Massachusetts: too far away from where good avocadoes and other tropical fruits are grown, to get avocadoes with decent quality. Whatever does survive the shipping journey that far North is usually picked much too green. Around the holidays such as Christmas and 16 de Septiembre and 5 de Mayo etc., there was ONE Mexican food store in Chicago that got some fresh, air-flown ripe Mexican avocadoes for sale just for these special days..at $5 each!   Mom who was raised in Texas was desperate for a good avocado because they are almost nonexistent in Chicago, so she bought 2 of those $5 avocados for Christmas dinner and said it was worth it. I had a small taste in my salad, it was great but geez $5 a piece LOL! I'm real glad we left Chicago and moved to Texas soon after that! I wouldn't count on S. California's avocado crop doing well anytime in the near future, as that area is likely to only have worse and worse water shortages and drought problems as time goes forward.  So perhaps, sadly, the 'Fuerte' avocadoes and the other delicious S Cali avocadoes you were raised on are going the way of the dodo. I hope not because they are very good avocadoes and it's always nice to be able to get USA grown tropical fruits. But unless some amazing advances in water and climate management are made to save the Cali avocado farms from extinction, your delicious S Cali grown avocadoes may become nothing more than a fond memory. </RelAText>

Stainless steel seems like it would be acceptable since this is how commercial kitchens brew batches of tea, but it looks like home stainless-steel pitchers are an afterthought.

        <RelAText>If you have room to place the Wellingtons on the same shelf, you simply cook them in the same way as you would a single one. Conventional ovens do not work like microwaves - the amount of stuff in the oven makes no difference, providing air flow is maintained and you don't have something large right up at the top or bottom blocking an element. Fan ovens are especially useful as they actively circulate the heat around the oven cavity, so you can cook things on two different levels with fairly good consistency. </RelAText>

        <RelAText>I recon it has formed like a cake after cooling. The best option you have is to take a big chunk of it in a microwaveable container (making sure that you are not breaking the rice grains) and sprinkling with some water. Then cover with a cling film and microwave for 3-4 minutes from cold. Your rice grains will separate because of the extra moisture from the sprinkled water and the Pulao will become slightly moist.   But yes, Pulao is a dry dish and needs to be eaten with a side like Raita or Salan. </RelAText>

        <RelAText>Pulao is usually a &quot;dry&quot; dish without any gravy/sauce left in it when it finishes cooking. If the rice seems to be fully cooked and the individual grains do not seem to be under cooked or slightly crunchy then I think it is probably correct.  Many people serve raita (I like a simple yoghurt-onion-tomato mix with some chili powder and salt) and green coriander chutney along with pulao or biryani which helps to make the overall experience less dry. I usually cook the marinade as well to make a gravy/salan to serve on the side when I make chicken biryani. </RelAText>

        <RelAText>Unless contaminated by, say, drinking straight out of the bottle, it will likely be safe to consume, but it will probably have deteriorated in quality. Sake which is no longer appealing to drink may be suitable for use in cooking; if you're not accustomed to cooking with sake, consider something simple, like potatoes simmered with a modest amount of water, sake, salt  pepper, soy sauce and butter. Low-alcohol beverages, whether fermented or slightly fortified, tend to deteriorate in quality over time, although they will become stale less slowly if their containers are sealed airtight and chilled. Port, marsala, sherry, vermouth, wine and sake all typically best consumed within a short time after opening, although the specific chemistry may vary. Some folks consider a sake that's been open, unrefrigerated, for more than a few weeks undrinkable. I don't know if I'm that rigid, but it's a good benchmark. I've seen certain sakes do ok for a few months in the refrigerator. </RelAText>

        <RelAText>It will keep until it doesn't. Eventually it will spoil, but because sake is considerably above the magic number for alcohol concentration to be self preserving when sealed (&gt;12.3% alcohol by volume), so long as you don't let any alcohol tolerant microbes into the bottle, then it will be fine. Smell it first,'if it smells earthy, throw it out, if it smells vinegary, you can use it but it's not rally sake anymore, it's rice wine vinegar. If you want, and if it's say half full, water it down and add a touch of cider vinegar to it. Cider vinegar isn't pasteurized so it will have live acetobacters in it and you can make your own vinegar. You need to cut the sake to half strength though otherwise it's too strong for the acetobacter to grow. </RelAText>

        <RelAText>Commercial pizza places usually use plastic dough proofing trays. They interlock and provide a relatively air-tight seal when they stack on top of each other. If you're looking for something that fits in your refrigerator, you should look into Artisan DoughMate trays. They are are 1/2 of the size of standard restaurant sized trays and you can fit a couple in your home fridge (Just under 18&quot; x 14&quot;) They stack with a very good air-tight seal and you just need a lid for the top one. You should be able to fit about six dough balls to a tray. If your only talking 2-3 dough balls then one tray would work, with a lid. But you also can look at aluminum dough pans. Some of these are also stackable with lids, and you put one dough ball into each one. I've often seen people spray the pans with oil so that the dough releases easily, or spray the dough balls so that if they spread into each other while proofing that don't make one massive dough ball. </RelAText>

        <RelAText>Try coating the dough ball with a little olive oil or a non-stick spray.  I don't know if that's the reason why but it's what I always do when baking bread and I never have a crust form during the rise. </RelAText>

        <RelAText>If you insist on using a damp cloth, you have to make it wet again and again, so this is quite cumbersome especially with long proofing times. Much easier is plastic wrap, which doesn't prevent the dough from rising if you use it to cover a sufficiently large bowl. Tightly wrapping the dough itself obviously won't work. My prefered method for these very long raises is a large food-safe plastic container with a lid. It doesn't have to be super-airtight and as I usually do a round of &quot;stretch and fold&quot; or quick punchdown every 12-24 hours I never had a problem with dried or overflowing dough.  </RelAText>

        <RelCText>If the company that puts out the fryer specifically says that 2.5 liters is required... is there a reason you think less would be OK?

        <RelAText>If you need a larger basket to fry the amount of food you want to cook, you need more oil as well. If you don't always want to make that much food (or use that much oil) then you need a smaller vessel for deep-frying, such as a second fryer or a small wok or kadai.  If you put less oil in than the minimum it may not cover the food and/or the oil could overheat, depending on how the fryer manages its temperature settings. Overheating oil can be dangerous and will also burn your food while leaving it raw inside. All around, something to avoid.  You can save and reuse frying oil. There are some good tips at the sites below. Let it cool fully then filter out food particles (I use coffee filters and a funnel for this; it can be a slow drain, be patient) Refrigerate used oil to retard bacterial growth  Stop using it if it looks weird or smells funny! http://www.seriouseats.com/2013/09/ask-the-food-lab-how-many-times-can-i-reuse-fry-oil.html http://extension.psu.edu/food/preservation/faq/questions-and-answers-about-re-using-frying-oil http://www.epicurious.com/expert-advice/you-can-reuse-frying-oil-article </RelAText>

        <RelAText>I'd dare say a small amount of oil can work if there is ample,controlled resupply of heat - why would it make much difference if it is coming from the vessel wall or more oil. However, I found that deep friers are just not designed for that, relying on the oil fill as thermal mass a lot... even or especially the small &quot;fondue&quot; style ones*. TL;DR for the rest of post: Advice on deep frying without using a fryer. Use at your own risk. You are better off with a chip pan/wok/pot and a thermometer for the kind of job where you just want to oil-blanch an ingredient and/or want to minimise oil usage because you do not want to reuse it (eg you want to fry tofu in fresh oil because it tends to be a magnet for the worst flavors it can get from old oil, you want to deep fry something with a strongly spiced and/or unruly rub/breading/batter on it, you want to fry ingredients like carrots or red bell pepper that will discolor the oil, you want to heat the oil very high initially to account for a temperature drop). The largest plate on even a normal electric hob is around 2000W - same as a medium sized home deep fryer, and pots and pans are optimized to transfer these 2000W to what is in them.  If you are not confident with open deep frying, have someone who is work with you for a while - yes it is hazardous, but manageably so - never leave the setup unattended. especially if no food in oil, monitor thermometer closely. always have something made of metal (nothing else) in reach that can cover the pot. always assume something can boil over. keep clutter away from your work area. use really high-heat oil - peanut, refined safflower, soy, rice bran; not some unspecified compound oil with a 180°C warning. be especially careful with induction, can heat a pot with small amounts of liquid in them alarmingly quick. keep the lid off as long as you are heating. if working on gas, ask someone who has experience in doing so for additional advice (overboiling into the burner is an obvious danger!), i'm electric... *the small ones that are partially plastic in construction - never managed to set a grease fire, but I think I would be far more at a loss to control one with these things than in a pot... </RelAText>

        <RelAText>I've used two different home-kitchen deep fryers over the last 18 years or so; one of them was essentially a kettle with a hidden heating element, and the other has a removable heating element that sits under the frying basket. The early one I used, the type with the hidden heating element, really has no minimum other than the basic rule-of-thumb that want at least 3x-4x the volume of oil to food being cooked, so that the oil doesn't cool down too quickly. The basket was the other factor, but if I remember correctly, my basket got pretty close to the bottom of the pan, so that wasn't a major consideration. A more serious model that I now use, which has a feature for filtering/draining oil, a more convincing thermostat, and electronic timers, has some more serious constraints, notably a minimum oil content of about 2.5 liters, and a maximum of maybe a tad over three liters. The minimum is pretty simple to explain: If you use less than 2.5 liters, none of the food will have enough room to float above the basket. You probably won't even cover the heating element without at least a liter of oil in there. Not covering the heating element has some serious consequences, namely the risk of the element glowing and eventually over-heating (based on the thermostat probe placement), oil spatter, and the more practical one of not being able to use the basket. The maximum fill line is an approximation designed to reduce the risk of oil boil-over. Having dealt with a oil boil-over on a friteuse meant for stovetop use in my starving student days in Germany, I can tell you the consequences are unpleasant. I had scars to prove it. High water content in some foods leads to furious bubbling, and if those bubbles manage to carry oil over the side of the pan, bad things happen. </RelAText>

          <RelACText>That was my thought, too -- I've seen way too many fryers where the basket stays an inch or two above the bottom, so a good deal of the oil is more heat-sync than actually coming into contact w/ the food.</RelACText>

        <RelAText>The whole point of deep frying is to use large amounts of oil. You don't want to just coat the food. You really need to have the food swim in a mass of oil much larger than the mass of the food. Else the food will cool down the oil locally and you won't get the desired crust.  So no, as long as you are using a large basket (which holds a large amount of food), you can't do proper deep frying with a small amount of oil. A consumer style deep fryer is probably already on the low side of the correct oil/food ratio.  </RelAText>

A few weeks ago I decided to try substituting the same quantity of home-made  greek-style yogurt in place of the whipping cream. They did not tenderize at all and although being fully cooked, were ‘crunchy’ and not desireable. As an experiment yesterday, I did another batch with part of it done with the original recipe using whipping cream,,  the rest with yogurt.

        <RelCText>Without seeing the recipe (permissions issue - it is not a public doc) it is hard to know if something else is going on, but at a minimum, the water content in cream is significantly higher than in Greek-style (strained) yogurt. I suspect that a non-strained yogurt would probably have a similar result to your cream version. You can also &quot;reconstitute&quot; strained yogurt by mixing water or milk in to give it a thinner texture which would also probably work. I doubt it is a chemical reaction, but the recipe would help.</RelCText>

    <OrgQSubject>Method to brew a large batch of iced tea without steeping in a plastic container</OrgQSubject>
    <OrgQBody> I have concerns about steeping tea in plastic pitcher because I do not want anything to leach out of the plastic with the hot water.  Glass would solve this problem, but it does not handle thermal shock well, so it is usually a matter of time before a glass pitcher will shatter if it is routinely used for brewing.  A traditional brewing method would be a ceramic tea pot, but my experience is that these pots are designed to brew hot tea a cup or two at a time.  I have not seen any large teapots designed to accommodate 32 oz or more of tea. Stainless steel seems like it would be acceptable since this is how commercial kitchens brew batches of tea, but it looks like home stainless-steel pitchers are an afterthought. Few have lids and those that do are generally not airtight, so after the brew is complete it would need to be transferred into a different pitcher and chilled for storage or plastic wrap over the top.  Certainly there must be a best practice for brewing iced tea at home without a plastic container, right?  </OrgQBody>

        <RelAText>The amount of grease the meat exudes is dependent upon the amount of fat in the beef. If your beef is lean (10% fat), you will not likely notice a difference in the greasiness in the final product by not straining. If your meat is fatty (ground beef in the US can contain up to 30% fat), then the final product will have noticeable grease. The fat contributes in a good way (IMO) to the flavor and mouth-feel of chili if the meat is in the 15% range.  </RelAText>

        <RelCText>Have to suspect something about your cooking practices contributes to any issues you are having with PTFE. I did finally replace my 20 year old frying pan with a new one a few years back (as much for the new, thicker aluminum part as for a new cooking surface.) I don't use the PTFE for high-heat applications it's unsuited to, and I use non-metallic utensils appropriate for not scratching up the surface. OTOH, the iron skillet I went off to college with is still going strong, but I use them for different things...</RelCText>

        <RelCText>Possibly, I have changed a few things over time. When I brown meat for the slow cooker, I now use cast iron. I've warped a few aluminum non sticks doing this because I add water to the pan to get the browning out to add to the roast. Other than that it seems that most frying pans just wont stay flat and tend to shed their coatings withing 5 or 6 years.</RelCText>

        <RelAText>I find that the chemical and mechanical reactions between egg-white, egg-yolk and sugar is quite an delicate and complex one. I find that there is even a difference in using white refined cane sugar and white refined beet sugars when baking and the amount of effort of creaming eggs and sugar. Sugar substitutes that claim that they &quot;behave&quot; the same as sugar also don't seem to react in a manner that you'd expect. I would suggest that you try a range of sugars...

        <RelQSubject>Flavor in avocadoes gone forever?</RelQSubject>
        <RelQBody>I got some made-in-store supermarket guacamole yesterday and it was a new low in bland, watery, flavorless avocado meat. I have read that the reason modern avocadoes taste bland is because they use a variety called a &quot;Hass&quot; avocado that growers prefer because it is resistant to some kinds of blight and it does not spoil as readily as other varieties. Nevertheless, as someone who remembers as a boy getting avocadoes that tasted like, well, avocadoes and actually having good guacamole, it is really discouraging the world takeover of this tasteless drone avocado called the Hass. Also, it seems the Hass itself seems to be getting more bland and more watery year by year. Is there any way to get good avocado varieties of the old type that actually taste good, or have they gone the way of the Dodo? (I should mention that I grew up in San Diego, but now live in Massachusetts so this might be part of the problem; good avocadoes might only be available locally in Southern California.) Update By some further research I have found that apparently large numbers of avocadoes are being exported by Peru, and even though they are Hass avocadoes they are reputedly MUCH more bland than California avocadoes, but also much cheaper. So, this might be the problem, I am getting Peruvian avocadoes. </RelQBody>

        <RelAText>You're exactly right in figuring out that part of the problem is having grown up with some of the world's best avocadoes, and then moving up North where decent avocadoes are scarce!  :)  Tasty avocadoes aren't all going the way of the dodo just yet, but you might have to move to Texas or Florida, or check some Mexican markets in your area, to get better avocadoes.  My husband lived in S Calif. as a child. He is an avocado connoisseur like you, as a result. Some of the best S Cali avocadoes are 'Fuerte' variety, which is more flavorful and creamier than Hass. We live in Texas and we get some very good, tasty Mexican avocadoes here- which by the way, are Hass.  But every single avocado I've brought home to hubby, whether from Mexico, Chile, Florida, Arizona, the Caribbean, Hawaii, Guatemala or Peru, ends up being compared unfavorably to those great S Calif. avocados he remembers. We visited a relative in the S Calif. area about 4.5 years ago and hubby had a delicious, fresh S Cali 'Fuerte' variety avocado during that trip--an avocado which he still recalls most fondly.  Personally I tried that same S Cali 'Fuerte' avocado too on that trip and while it was a bit tastier than the Hass avocadoes we currently get in Texas, I didn't find the flavor all THAT much better!  But hubby did prefer it a lot; he likes what he was raised on. Also his palate is more sensitive to bitterness than mine and 'Fuerte' is less bitter than Hass. In recent years, Calif. drought has made the delicious Cali avocadoes, especially the 'Fuerte', nearly impossible to get.  By the way- I lived in Illinois for a while. That state has the same avocado problem as Massachusetts: too far away from where good avocadoes and other tropical fruits are grown, to get avocadoes with decent quality. Whatever does survive the shipping journey that far North is usually picked much too green. Around the holidays such as Christmas and 16 de Septiembre and 5 de Mayo etc., there was ONE Mexican food store in Chicago that got some fresh, air-flown ripe Mexican avocadoes for sale just for these special days..at $5 each!   Mom who was raised in Texas was desperate for a good avocado because they are almost nonexistent in Chicago, so she bought 2 of those $5 avocados for Christmas dinner and said it was worth it. I had a small taste in my salad, it was great but geez $5 a piece LOL! I'm real glad we left Chicago and moved to Texas soon after that! I wouldn't count on S. California's avocado crop doing well anytime in the near future, as that area is likely to only have worse and worse water shortages and drought problems as time goes forward.  So perhaps, sadly, the 'Fuerte' avocadoes and the other delicious S Cali avocadoes you were raised on are going the way of the dodo. I hope not because they are very good avocadoes and it's always nice to be able to get USA grown tropical fruits. But unless some amazing advances in water and climate management are made to save the Cali avocado farms from extinction, your delicious S Cali grown avocadoes may become nothing more than a fond memory. </RelAText>

        <RelAText>If you have room to place the Wellingtons on the same shelf, you simply cook them in the same way as you would a single one. Conventional ovens do not work like microwaves - the amount of stuff in the oven makes no difference, providing air flow is maintained and you don't have something large right up at the top or bottom blocking an element. Fan ovens are especially useful as they actively circulate the heat around the oven cavity, so you can cook things on two different levels with fairly good consistency. </RelAText>

        <RelAText>I recon it has formed like a cake after cooling. The best option you have is to take a big chunk of it in a microwaveable container (making sure that you are not breaking the rice grains) and sprinkling with some water. Then cover with a cling film and microwave for 3-4 minutes from cold. Your rice grains will separate because of the extra moisture from the sprinkled water and the Pulao will become slightly moist.   But yes, Pulao is a dry dish and needs to be eaten with a side like Raita or Salan. </RelAText>

        <RelAText>Pulao is usually a &quot;dry&quot; dish without any gravy/sauce left in it when it finishes cooking. If the rice seems to be fully cooked and the individual grains do not seem to be under cooked or slightly crunchy then I think it is probably correct.  Many people serve raita (I like a simple yoghurt-onion-tomato mix with some chili powder and salt) and green coriander chutney along with pulao or biryani which helps to make the overall experience less dry. I usually cook the marinade as well to make a gravy/salan to serve on the side when I make chicken biryani. </RelAText>

        <RelAText>Unless contaminated by, say, drinking straight out of the bottle, it will likely be safe to consume, but it will probably have deteriorated in quality. Sake which is no longer appealing to drink may be suitable for use in cooking; if you're not accustomed to cooking with sake, consider something simple, like potatoes simmered with a modest amount of water, sake, salt  pepper, soy sauce and butter. Low-alcohol beverages, whether fermented or slightly fortified, tend to deteriorate in quality over time, although they will become stale less slowly if their containers are sealed airtight and chilled. Port, marsala, sherry, vermouth, wine and sake all typically best consumed within a short time after opening, although the specific chemistry may vary. Some folks consider a sake that's been open, unrefrigerated, for more than a few weeks undrinkable. I don't know if I'm that rigid, but it's a good benchmark. I've seen certain sakes do ok for a few months in the refrigerator. </RelAText>

        <RelAText>It will keep until it doesn't. Eventually it will spoil, but because sake is considerably above the magic number for alcohol concentration to be self preserving when sealed (&gt;12.3% alcohol by volume), so long as you don't let any alcohol tolerant microbes into the bottle, then it will be fine. Smell it first,'if it smells earthy, throw it out, if it smells vinegary, you can use it but it's not rally sake anymore, it's rice wine vinegar. If you want, and if it's say half full, water it down and add a touch of cider vinegar to it. Cider vinegar isn't pasteurized so it will have live acetobacters in it and you can make your own vinegar. You need to cut the sake to half strength though otherwise it's too strong for the acetobacter to grow. </RelAText>

        <RelQBody>While proofing, the crust can appear on the dough balls if in contact with air (oxygen). I tried preventing by damp cloth but it still happens.

        <RelAText>Commercial pizza places usually use plastic dough proofing trays. They interlock and provide a relatively air-tight seal when they stack on top of each other. If you're looking for something that fits in your refrigerator, you should look into Artisan DoughMate trays. They are are 1/2 of the size of standard restaurant sized trays and you can fit a couple in your home fridge (Just under 18&quot; x 14&quot;) They stack with a very good air-tight seal and you just need a lid for the top one. You should be able to fit about six dough balls to a tray. If your only talking 2-3 dough balls then one tray would work, with a lid. But you also can look at aluminum dough pans. Some of these are also stackable with lids, and you put one dough ball into each one. I've often seen people spray the pans with oil so that the dough releases easily, or spray the dough balls so that if they spread into each other while proofing that don't make one massive dough ball. </RelAText>

        <RelAText>Try coating the dough ball with a little olive oil or a non-stick spray.  I don't know if that's the reason why but it's what I always do when baking bread and I never have a crust form during the rise. </RelAText>

        <RelAText>If you insist on using a damp cloth, you have to make it wet again and again, so this is quite cumbersome especially with long proofing times. Much easier is plastic wrap, which doesn't prevent the dough from rising if you use it to cover a sufficiently large bowl. Tightly wrapping the dough itself obviously won't work. My prefered method for these very long raises is a large food-safe plastic container with a lid. It doesn't have to be super-airtight and as I usually do a round of &quot;stretch and fold&quot; or quick punchdown every 12-24 hours I never had a problem with dried or overflowing dough.  </RelAText>

        <RelAText>If you need a larger basket to fry the amount of food you want to cook, you need more oil as well. If you don't always want to make that much food (or use that much oil) then you need a smaller vessel for deep-frying, such as a second fryer or a small wok or kadai.  If you put less oil in than the minimum it may not cover the food and/or the oil could overheat, depending on how the fryer manages its temperature settings. Overheating oil can be dangerous and will also burn your food while leaving it raw inside. All around, something to avoid.  You can save and reuse frying oil. There are some good tips at the sites below. Let it cool fully then filter out food particles (I use coffee filters and a funnel for this; it can be a slow drain, be patient) Refrigerate used oil to retard bacterial growth  Stop using it if it looks weird or smells funny! http://www.seriouseats.com/2013/09/ask-the-food-lab-how-many-times-can-i-reuse-fry-oil.html http://extension.psu.edu/food/preservation/faq/questions-and-answers-about-re-using-frying-oil http://www.epicurious.com/expert-advice/you-can-reuse-frying-oil-article </RelAText>

        <RelAText>I'd dare say a small amount of oil can work if there is ample,controlled resupply of heat - why would it make much difference if it is coming from the vessel wall or more oil. However, I found that deep friers are just not designed for that, relying on the oil fill as thermal mass a lot... even or especially the small &quot;fondue&quot; style ones*. TL;DR for the rest of post: Advice on deep frying without using a fryer. Use at your own risk. You are better off with a chip pan/wok/pot and a thermometer for the kind of job where you just want to oil-blanch an ingredient and/or want to minimise oil usage because you do not want to reuse it (eg you want to fry tofu in fresh oil because it tends to be a magnet for the worst flavors it can get from old oil, you want to deep fry something with a strongly spiced and/or unruly rub/breading/batter on it, you want to fry ingredients like carrots or red bell pepper that will discolor the oil, you want to heat the oil very high initially to account for a temperature drop). The largest plate on even a normal electric hob is around 2000W - same as a medium sized home deep fryer, and pots and pans are optimized to transfer these 2000W to what is in them.  If you are not confident with open deep frying, have someone who is work with you for a while - yes it is hazardous, but manageably so - never leave the setup unattended. especially if no food in oil, monitor thermometer closely. always have something made of metal (nothing else) in reach that can cover the pot. always assume something can boil over. keep clutter away from your work area. use really high-heat oil - peanut, refined safflower, soy, rice bran; not some unspecified compound oil with a 180°C warning. be especially careful with induction, can heat a pot with small amounts of liquid in them alarmingly quick. keep the lid off as long as you are heating. if working on gas, ask someone who has experience in doing so for additional advice (overboiling into the burner is an obvious danger!), i'm electric... *the small ones that are partially plastic in construction - never managed to set a grease fire, but I think I would be far more at a loss to control one with these things than in a pot... </RelAText>

        <RelAText>I've used two different home-kitchen deep fryers over the last 18 years or so; one of them was essentially a kettle with a hidden heating element, and the other has a removable heating element that sits under the frying basket. The early one I used, the type with the hidden heating element, really has no minimum other than the basic rule-of-thumb that want at least 3x-4x the volume of oil to food being cooked, so that the oil doesn't cool down too quickly. The basket was the other factor, but if I remember correctly, my basket got pretty close to the bottom of the pan, so that wasn't a major consideration. A more serious model that I now use, which has a feature for filtering/draining oil, a more convincing thermostat, and electronic timers, has some more serious constraints, notably a minimum oil content of about 2.5 liters, and a maximum of maybe a tad over three liters. The minimum is pretty simple to explain: If you use less than 2.5 liters, none of the food will have enough room to float above the basket. You probably won't even cover the heating element without at least a liter of oil in there. Not covering the heating element has some serious consequences, namely the risk of the element glowing and eventually over-heating (based on the thermostat probe placement), oil spatter, and the more practical one of not being able to use the basket. The maximum fill line is an approximation designed to reduce the risk of oil boil-over. Having dealt with a oil boil-over on a friteuse meant for stovetop use in my starving student days in Germany, I can tell you the consequences are unpleasant. I had scars to prove it. High water content in some foods leads to furious bubbling, and if those bubbles manage to carry oil over the side of the pan, bad things happen. </RelAText>

          <RelACText>That was my thought, too -- I've seen way too many fryers where the basket stays an inch or two above the bottom, so a good deal of the oil is more heat-sync than actually coming into contact w/ the food.</RelACText>

        <RelAText>The whole point of deep frying is to use large amounts of oil. You don't want to just coat the food. You really need to have the food swim in a mass of oil much larger than the mass of the food. Else the food will cool down the oil locally and you won't get the desired crust.  So no, as long as you are using a large basket (which holds a large amount of food), you can't do proper deep frying with a small amount of oil. A consumer style deep fryer is probably already on the low side of the correct oil/food ratio.  </RelAText>

        <RelQBody>I have a favorite tried  true recipe that I simply call ‘foil potatoes’.  recipe link: http://www.evernote.com/shard/s1/sh/048c56cc-1481-48b2-89e6-88e897da651a/b0c036a6448b07e0a486f77acf2111cb This has been made multiple times with consistently good results. A few weeks ago I decided to try substituting the same quantity of home-made  greek-style yogurt in place of the whipping cream. They did not tenderize at all and although being fully cooked, were ‘crunchy’ and not desireable. As an experiment yesterday, I did another batch with part of it done with the original recipe using whipping cream,,  the rest with yogurt. All packets were done on the same grill side-by side with exactly the same time  temp. The packets with whipping cream were done perfectly  again the ones with yogurt were tough. My internet searches have not found any answers as to why this happened. In addition to wanting to understand the science of this difference, can anyone suggest changes I can make to have this substitution work? </RelQBody>

        <RelCText>Without seeing the recipe (permissions issue - it is not a public doc) it is hard to know if something else is going on, but at a minimum, the water content in cream is significantly higher than in Greek-style (strained) yogurt. I suspect that a non-strained yogurt would probably have a similar result to your cream version. You can also &quot;reconstitute&quot; strained yogurt by mixing water or milk in to give it a thinner texture which would also probably work. I doubt it is a chemical reaction, but the recipe would help.</RelCText>

        <RelAText>The amount of grease the meat exudes is dependent upon the amount of fat in the beef. If your beef is lean (10% fat), you will not likely notice a difference in the greasiness in the final product by not straining. If your meat is fatty (ground beef in the US can contain up to 30% fat), then the final product will have noticeable grease. The fat contributes in a good way (IMO) to the flavor and mouth-feel of chili if the meat is in the 15% range.  </RelAText>

        <RelCText>Have to suspect something about your cooking practices contributes to any issues you are having with PTFE. I did finally replace my 20 year old frying pan with a new one a few years back (as much for the new, thicker aluminum part as for a new cooking surface.) I don't use the PTFE for high-heat applications it's unsuited to, and I use non-metallic utensils appropriate for not scratching up the surface. OTOH, the iron skillet I went off to college with is still going strong, but I use them for different things...</RelCText>

        <RelCText>Possibly, I have changed a few things over time. When I brown meat for the slow cooker, I now use cast iron. I've warped a few aluminum non sticks doing this because I add water to the pan to get the browning out to add to the roast. Other than that it seems that most frying pans just wont stay flat and tend to shed their coatings withing 5 or 6 years.</RelCText>

Sugar substitutes that claim that they &quot;behave&quot; the same as sugar also don't seem to react in a manner that you'd expect. I would suggest that you try a range of sugars...

        <RelQSubject>Flavor in avocadoes gone forever?</RelQSubject>
        <RelQBody>I got some made-in-store supermarket guacamole yesterday and it was a new low in bland, watery, flavorless avocado meat. I have read that the reason modern avocadoes taste bland is because they use a variety called a &quot;Hass&quot; avocado that growers prefer because it is resistant to some kinds of blight and it does not spoil as readily as other varieties. Nevertheless, as someone who remembers as a boy getting avocadoes that tasted like, well, avocadoes and actually having good guacamole, it is really discouraging the world takeover of this tasteless drone avocado called the Hass. Also, it seems the Hass itself seems to be getting more bland and more watery year by year. Is there any way to get good avocado varieties of the old type that actually taste good, or have they gone the way of the Dodo? (I should mention that I grew up in San Diego, but now live in Massachusetts so this might be part of the problem; good avocadoes might only be available locally in Southern California.) Update By some further research I have found that apparently large numbers of avocadoes are being exported by Peru, and even though they are Hass avocadoes they are reputedly MUCH more bland than California avocadoes, but also much cheaper. So, this might be the problem, I am getting Peruvian avocadoes. </RelQBody>

        <RelAText>You're exactly right in figuring out that part of the problem is having grown up with some of the world's best avocadoes, and then moving up North where decent avocadoes are scarce!  :)  Tasty avocadoes aren't all going the way of the dodo just yet, but you might have to move to Texas or Florida, or check some Mexican markets in your area, to get better avocadoes.  My husband lived in S Calif. as a child. He is an avocado connoisseur like you, as a result. Some of the best S Cali avocadoes are 'Fuerte' variety, which is more flavorful and creamier than Hass. We live in Texas and we get some very good, tasty Mexican avocadoes here- which by the way, are Hass.  But every single avocado I've brought home to hubby, whether from Mexico, Chile, Florida, Arizona, the Caribbean, Hawaii, Guatemala or Peru, ends up being compared unfavorably to those great S Calif. avocados he remembers. We visited a relative in the S Calif. area about 4.5 years ago and hubby had a delicious, fresh S Cali 'Fuerte' variety avocado during that trip--an avocado which he still recalls most fondly.  Personally I tried that same S Cali 'Fuerte' avocado too on that trip and while it was a bit tastier than the Hass avocadoes we currently get in Texas, I didn't find the flavor all THAT much better!  But hubby did prefer it a lot; he likes what he was raised on. Also his palate is more sensitive to bitterness than mine and 'Fuerte' is less bitter than Hass. In recent years, Calif. drought has made the delicious Cali avocadoes, especially the 'Fuerte', nearly impossible to get.  By the way- I lived in Illinois for a while. That state has the same avocado problem as Massachusetts: too far away from where good avocadoes and other tropical fruits are grown, to get avocadoes with decent quality. Whatever does survive the shipping journey that far North is usually picked much too green. Around the holidays such as Christmas and 16 de Septiembre and 5 de Mayo etc., there was ONE Mexican food store in Chicago that got some fresh, air-flown ripe Mexican avocadoes for sale just for these special days..at $5 each!   Mom who was raised in Texas was desperate for a good avocado because they are almost nonexistent in Chicago, so she bought 2 of those $5 avocados for Christmas dinner and said it was worth it. I had a small taste in my salad, it was great but geez $5 a piece LOL! I'm real glad we left Chicago and moved to Texas soon after that! I wouldn't count on S. California's avocado crop doing well anytime in the near future, as that area is likely to only have worse and worse water shortages and drought problems as time goes forward.  So perhaps, sadly, the 'Fuerte' avocadoes and the other delicious S Cali avocadoes you were raised on are going the way of the dodo. I hope not because they are very good avocadoes and it's always nice to be able to get USA grown tropical fruits. But unless some amazing advances in water and climate management are made to save the Cali avocado farms from extinction, your delicious S Cali grown avocadoes may become nothing more than a fond memory. </RelAText>

        <RelAText>If you have room to place the Wellingtons on the same shelf, you simply cook them in the same way as you would a single one. Conventional ovens do not work like microwaves - the amount of stuff in the oven makes no difference, providing air flow is maintained and you don't have something large right up at the top or bottom blocking an element. Fan ovens are especially useful as they actively circulate the heat around the oven cavity, so you can cook things on two different levels with fairly good consistency. </RelAText>

        <RelAText>I recon it has formed like a cake after cooling. The best option you have is to take a big chunk of it in a microwaveable container (making sure that you are not breaking the rice grains) and sprinkling with some water. Then cover with a cling film and microwave for 3-4 minutes from cold. Your rice grains will separate because of the extra moisture from the sprinkled water and the Pulao will become slightly moist.   But yes, Pulao is a dry dish and needs to be eaten with a side like Raita or Salan. </RelAText>

        <RelAText>Pulao is usually a &quot;dry&quot; dish without any gravy/sauce left in it when it finishes cooking. If the rice seems to be fully cooked and the individual grains do not seem to be under cooked or slightly crunchy then I think it is probably correct.  Many people serve raita (I like a simple yoghurt-onion-tomato mix with some chili powder and salt) and green coriander chutney along with pulao or biryani which helps to make the overall experience less dry. I usually cook the marinade as well to make a gravy/salan to serve on the side when I make chicken biryani. </RelAText>

        <RelAText>Unless contaminated by, say, drinking straight out of the bottle, it will likely be safe to consume, but it will probably have deteriorated in quality. Sake which is no longer appealing to drink may be suitable for use in cooking; if you're not accustomed to cooking with sake, consider something simple, like potatoes simmered with a modest amount of water, sake, salt  pepper, soy sauce and butter. Low-alcohol beverages, whether fermented or slightly fortified, tend to deteriorate in quality over time, although they will become stale less slowly if their containers are sealed airtight and chilled. Port, marsala, sherry, vermouth, wine and sake all typically best consumed within a short time after opening, although the specific chemistry may vary. Some folks consider a sake that's been open, unrefrigerated, for more than a few weeks undrinkable. I don't know if I'm that rigid, but it's a good benchmark. I've seen certain sakes do ok for a few months in the refrigerator. </RelAText>

        <RelAText>It will keep until it doesn't. Eventually it will spoil, but because sake is considerably above the magic number for alcohol concentration to be self preserving when sealed (&gt;12.3% alcohol by volume), so long as you don't let any alcohol tolerant microbes into the bottle, then it will be fine. Smell it first,'if it smells earthy, throw it out, if it smells vinegary, you can use it but it's not rally sake anymore, it's rice wine vinegar. If you want, and if it's say half full, water it down and add a touch of cider vinegar to it. Cider vinegar isn't pasteurized so it will have live acetobacters in it and you can make your own vinegar. You need to cut the sake to half strength though otherwise it's too strong for the acetobacter to grow. </RelAText>

        <RelAText>Commercial pizza places usually use plastic dough proofing trays. They interlock and provide a relatively air-tight seal when they stack on top of each other. If you're looking for something that fits in your refrigerator, you should look into Artisan DoughMate trays. They are are 1/2 of the size of standard restaurant sized trays and you can fit a couple in your home fridge (Just under 18&quot; x 14&quot;) They stack with a very good air-tight seal and you just need a lid for the top one. You should be able to fit about six dough balls to a tray. If your only talking 2-3 dough balls then one tray would work, with a lid. But you also can look at aluminum dough pans. Some of these are also stackable with lids, and you put one dough ball into each one. I've often seen people spray the pans with oil so that the dough releases easily, or spray the dough balls so that if they spread into each other while proofing that don't make one massive dough ball. </RelAText>

        <RelAText>Try coating the dough ball with a little olive oil or a non-stick spray.  I don't know if that's the reason why but it's what I always do when baking bread and I never have a crust form during the rise. </RelAText>

        <RelAText>If you insist on using a damp cloth, you have to make it wet again and again, so this is quite cumbersome especially with long proofing times. Much easier is plastic wrap, which doesn't prevent the dough from rising if you use it to cover a sufficiently large bowl. Tightly wrapping the dough itself obviously won't work. My prefered method for these very long raises is a large food-safe plastic container with a lid. It doesn't have to be super-airtight and as I usually do a round of &quot;stretch and fold&quot; or quick punchdown every 12-24 hours I never had a problem with dried or overflowing dough.  </RelAText>

        <RelAText>If you need a larger basket to fry the amount of food you want to cook, you need more oil as well. If you don't always want to make that much food (or use that much oil) then you need a smaller vessel for deep-frying, such as a second fryer or a small wok or kadai.  If you put less oil in than the minimum it may not cover the food and/or the oil could overheat, depending on how the fryer manages its temperature settings. Overheating oil can be dangerous and will also burn your food while leaving it raw inside. All around, something to avoid.  You can save and reuse frying oil. There are some good tips at the sites below. Let it cool fully then filter out food particles (I use coffee filters and a funnel for this; it can be a slow drain, be patient) Refrigerate used oil to retard bacterial growth  Stop using it if it looks weird or smells funny! http://www.seriouseats.com/2013/09/ask-the-food-lab-how-many-times-can-i-reuse-fry-oil.html http://extension.psu.edu/food/preservation/faq/questions-and-answers-about-re-using-frying-oil http://www.epicurious.com/expert-advice/you-can-reuse-frying-oil-article </RelAText>

        <RelAText>I'd dare say a small amount of oil can work if there is ample,controlled resupply of heat - why would it make much difference if it is coming from the vessel wall or more oil. However, I found that deep friers are just not designed for that, relying on the oil fill as thermal mass a lot... even or especially the small &quot;fondue&quot; style ones*. TL;DR for the rest of post: Advice on deep frying without using a fryer. Use at your own risk. You are better off with a chip pan/wok/pot and a thermometer for the kind of job where you just want to oil-blanch an ingredient and/or want to minimise oil usage because you do not want to reuse it (eg you want to fry tofu in fresh oil because it tends to be a magnet for the worst flavors it can get from old oil, you want to deep fry something with a strongly spiced and/or unruly rub/breading/batter on it, you want to fry ingredients like carrots or red bell pepper that will discolor the oil, you want to heat the oil very high initially to account for a temperature drop). The largest plate on even a normal electric hob is around 2000W - same as a medium sized home deep fryer, and pots and pans are optimized to transfer these 2000W to what is in them.  If you are not confident with open deep frying, have someone who is work with you for a while - yes it is hazardous, but manageably so - never leave the setup unattended. especially if no food in oil, monitor thermometer closely. always have something made of metal (nothing else) in reach that can cover the pot. always assume something can boil over. keep clutter away from your work area. use really high-heat oil - peanut, refined safflower, soy, rice bran; not some unspecified compound oil with a 180°C warning. be especially careful with induction, can heat a pot with small amounts of liquid in them alarmingly quick. keep the lid off as long as you are heating. if working on gas, ask someone who has experience in doing so for additional advice (overboiling into the burner is an obvious danger!), i'm electric... *the small ones that are partially plastic in construction - never managed to set a grease fire, but I think I would be far more at a loss to control one with these things than in a pot... </RelAText>

        <RelAText>I've used two different home-kitchen deep fryers over the last 18 years or so; one of them was essentially a kettle with a hidden heating element, and the other has a removable heating element that sits under the frying basket. The early one I used, the type with the hidden heating element, really has no minimum other than the basic rule-of-thumb that want at least 3x-4x the volume of oil to food being cooked, so that the oil doesn't cool down too quickly. The basket was the other factor, but if I remember correctly, my basket got pretty close to the bottom of the pan, so that wasn't a major consideration. A more serious model that I now use, which has a feature for filtering/draining oil, a more convincing thermostat, and electronic timers, has some more serious constraints, notably a minimum oil content of about 2.5 liters, and a maximum of maybe a tad over three liters. The minimum is pretty simple to explain: If you use less than 2.5 liters, none of the food will have enough room to float above the basket. You probably won't even cover the heating element without at least a liter of oil in there. Not covering the heating element has some serious consequences, namely the risk of the element glowing and eventually over-heating (based on the thermostat probe placement), oil spatter, and the more practical one of not being able to use the basket. The maximum fill line is an approximation designed to reduce the risk of oil boil-over. Having dealt with a oil boil-over on a friteuse meant for stovetop use in my starving student days in Germany, I can tell you the consequences are unpleasant. I had scars to prove it. High water content in some foods leads to furious bubbling, and if those bubbles manage to carry oil over the side of the pan, bad things happen. </RelAText>

          <RelACText>That was my thought, too -- I've seen way too many fryers where the basket stays an inch or two above the bottom, so a good deal of the oil is more heat-sync than actually coming into contact w/ the food.</RelACText>

        <RelAText>The whole point of deep frying is to use large amounts of oil. You don't want to just coat the food. You really need to have the food swim in a mass of oil much larger than the mass of the food. Else the food will cool down the oil locally and you won't get the desired crust.  So no, as long as you are using a large basket (which holds a large amount of food), you can't do proper deep frying with a small amount of oil. A consumer style deep fryer is probably already on the low side of the correct oil/food ratio.  </RelAText>

        <RelQBody>I have a favorite tried  true recipe that I simply call ‘foil potatoes’.  recipe link: http://www.evernote.com/shard/s1/sh/048c56cc-1481-48b2-89e6-88e897da651a/b0c036a6448b07e0a486f77acf2111cb This has been made multiple times with consistently good results. A few weeks ago I decided to try substituting the same quantity of home-made  greek-style yogurt in place of the whipping cream. They did not tenderize at all and although being fully cooked, were ‘crunchy’ and not desireable. As an experiment yesterday, I did another batch with part of it done with the original recipe using whipping cream,,  the rest with yogurt. All packets were done on the same grill side-by side with exactly the same time  temp. The packets with whipping cream were done perfectly  again the ones with yogurt were tough. My internet searches have not found any answers as to why this happened. In addition to wanting to understand the science of this difference, can anyone suggest changes I can make to have this substitution work? </RelQBody>

        <RelCText>Without seeing the recipe (permissions issue - it is not a public doc) it is hard to know if something else is going on, but at a minimum, the water content in cream is significantly higher than in Greek-style (strained) yogurt. I suspect that a non-strained yogurt would probably have a similar result to your cream version. You can also &quot;reconstitute&quot; strained yogurt by mixing water or milk in to give it a thinner texture which would also probably work. I doubt it is a chemical reaction, but the recipe would help.</RelCText>

        <RelAText>The amount of grease the meat exudes is dependent upon the amount of fat in the beef. If your beef is lean (10% fat), you will not likely notice a difference in the greasiness in the final product by not straining. If your meat is fatty (ground beef in the US can contain up to 30% fat), then the final product will have noticeable grease. The fat contributes in a good way (IMO) to the flavor and mouth-feel of chili if the meat is in the 15% range.  </RelAText>

        <RelCText>Have to suspect something about your cooking practices contributes to any issues you are having with PTFE. I did finally replace my 20 year old frying pan with a new one a few years back (as much for the new, thicker aluminum part as for a new cooking surface.) I don't use the PTFE for high-heat applications it's unsuited to, and I use non-metallic utensils appropriate for not scratching up the surface. OTOH, the iron skillet I went off to college with is still going strong, but I use them for different things...</RelCText>

        <RelCText>Possibly, I have changed a few things over time. When I brown meat for the slow cooker, I now use cast iron. I've warped a few aluminum non sticks doing this because I add water to the pan to get the browning out to add to the roast. Other than that it seems that most frying pans just wont stay flat and tend to shed their coatings withing 5 or 6 years.</RelCText>

        <RelAText>I find that the chemical and mechanical reactions between egg-white, egg-yolk and sugar is quite an delicate and complex one. I find that there is even a difference in using white refined cane sugar and white refined beet sugars when baking and the amount of effort of creaming eggs and sugar. Sugar substitutes that claim that they &quot;behave&quot; the same as sugar also don't seem to react in a manner that you'd expect. I would suggest that you try a range of sugars... The worse of them seems to be corn based sugars. The eggs just don't behave at all... </RelAText>

        <RelQBody>I got some made-in-store supermarket guacamole yesterday and it was a new low in bland, watery, flavorless avocado meat. I have read that the reason modern avocadoes taste bland is because they use a variety called a &quot;Hass&quot; avocado that growers prefer because it is resistant to some kinds of blight and it does not spoil as readily as other varieties. Nevertheless, as someone who remembers as a boy getting avocadoes that tasted like, well, avocadoes and actually having good guacamole, it is really discouraging the world takeover of this tasteless drone avocado called the Hass. Also, it seems the Hass itself seems to be getting more bland and more watery year by year. Is there any way to get good avocado varieties of the old type that actually taste good, or have they gone the way of the Dodo? (I should mention that I grew up in San Diego, but now live in Massachusetts so this might be part of the problem; good avocadoes might only be available locally in Southern California.) Update By some further research I have found that apparently large numbers of avocadoes are being exported by Peru, and even though they are Hass avocadoes they are reputedly MUCH more bland than California avocadoes, but also much cheaper.

        <RelCText>CA is in the midst of a drought. Haven't seen a good avocado from there all year. However, before the local Mexican market burned down, they were getting *Mexican grown avocados* the size of softballs that'd make your mouth water for more; cheap too!

        <RelCText>Good tropical fruit in Massachusetts is a rarity on all fronts. Picked underripe and shipped long distances does not ever compare well with picked at/near ripe from the farm up the road. Sometimes we see halfway decent Mexican or Florida avocados. Halfway decent is about as good as it gets.</RelCText>

        <RelAText>You're exactly right in figuring out that part of the problem is having grown up with some of the world's best avocadoes, and then moving up North where decent avocadoes are scarce!  :)  Tasty avocadoes aren't all going the way of the dodo just yet, but you might have to move to Texas or Florida, or check some Mexican markets in your area, to get better avocadoes.  My husband lived in S Calif. as a child. He is an avocado connoisseur like you, as a result. Some of the best S Cali avocadoes are 'Fuerte' variety, which is more flavorful and creamier than Hass. We live in Texas and we get some very good, tasty Mexican avocadoes here- which by the way, are Hass.  But every single avocado I've brought home to hubby, whether from Mexico, Chile, Florida, Arizona, the Caribbean, Hawaii, Guatemala or Peru, ends up being compared unfavorably to those great S Calif. avocados he remembers. We visited a relative in the S Calif. area about 4.5 years ago and hubby had a delicious, fresh S Cali 'Fuerte' variety avocado during that trip--an avocado which he still recalls most fondly.  Personally I tried that same S Cali 'Fuerte' avocado too on that trip and while it was a bit tastier than the Hass avocadoes we currently get in Texas, I didn't find the flavor all THAT much better!  But hubby did prefer it a lot; he likes what he was raised on. Also his palate is more sensitive to bitterness than mine and 'Fuerte' is less bitter than Hass. In recent years, Calif. drought has made the delicious Cali avocadoes, especially the 'Fuerte', nearly impossible to get.  By the way- I lived in Illinois for a while. That state has the same avocado problem as Massachusetts: too far away from where good avocadoes and other tropical fruits are grown, to get avocadoes with decent quality. Whatever does survive the shipping journey that far North is usually picked much too green. Around the holidays such as Christmas and 16 de Septiembre and 5 de Mayo etc., there was ONE Mexican food store in Chicago that got some fresh, air-flown ripe Mexican avocadoes for sale just for these special days..at $5 each!   Mom who was raised in Texas was desperate for a good avocado because they are almost nonexistent in Chicago, so she bought 2 of those $5 avocados for Christmas dinner and said it was worth it. I had a small taste in my salad, it was great but geez $5 a piece LOL! I'm real glad we left Chicago and moved to Texas soon after that! I wouldn't count on S. California's avocado crop doing well anytime in the near future, as that area is likely to only have worse and worse water shortages and drought problems as time goes forward.  So perhaps, sadly, the 'Fuerte' avocadoes and the other delicious S Cali avocadoes you were raised on are going the way of the dodo. I hope not because they are very good avocadoes and it's always nice to be able to get USA grown tropical fruits. But unless some amazing advances in water and climate management are made to save the Cali avocado farms from extinction, your delicious S Cali grown avocadoes may become nothing more than a fond memory. </RelAText>

        <RelAText>If you have room to place the Wellingtons on the same shelf, you simply cook them in the same way as you would a single one. Conventional ovens do not work like microwaves - the amount of stuff in the oven makes no difference, providing air flow is maintained and you don't have something large right up at the top or bottom blocking an element. Fan ovens are especially useful as they actively circulate the heat around the oven cavity, so you can cook things on two different levels with fairly good consistency. </RelAText>

        <RelAText>I recon it has formed like a cake after cooling. The best option you have is to take a big chunk of it in a microwaveable container (making sure that you are not breaking the rice grains) and sprinkling with some water. Then cover with a cling film and microwave for 3-4 minutes from cold. Your rice grains will separate because of the extra moisture from the sprinkled water and the Pulao will become slightly moist.   But yes, Pulao is a dry dish and needs to be eaten with a side like Raita or Salan. </RelAText>

        <RelAText>Pulao is usually a &quot;dry&quot; dish without any gravy/sauce left in it when it finishes cooking. If the rice seems to be fully cooked and the individual grains do not seem to be under cooked or slightly crunchy then I think it is probably correct.  Many people serve raita (I like a simple yoghurt-onion-tomato mix with some chili powder and salt) and green coriander chutney along with pulao or biryani which helps to make the overall experience less dry. I usually cook the marinade as well to make a gravy/salan to serve on the side when I make chicken biryani. </RelAText>

        <RelAText>Unless contaminated by, say, drinking straight out of the bottle, it will likely be safe to consume, but it will probably have deteriorated in quality. Sake which is no longer appealing to drink may be suitable for use in cooking; if you're not accustomed to cooking with sake, consider something simple, like potatoes simmered with a modest amount of water, sake, salt  pepper, soy sauce and butter. Low-alcohol beverages, whether fermented or slightly fortified, tend to deteriorate in quality over time, although they will become stale less slowly if their containers are sealed airtight and chilled. Port, marsala, sherry, vermouth, wine and sake all typically best consumed within a short time after opening, although the specific chemistry may vary. Some folks consider a sake that's been open, unrefrigerated, for more than a few weeks undrinkable. I don't know if I'm that rigid, but it's a good benchmark. I've seen certain sakes do ok for a few months in the refrigerator. </RelAText>

        <RelAText>It will keep until it doesn't. Eventually it will spoil, but because sake is considerably above the magic number for alcohol concentration to be self preserving when sealed (&gt;12.3% alcohol by volume), so long as you don't let any alcohol tolerant microbes into the bottle, then it will be fine. Smell it first,'if it smells earthy, throw it out, if it smells vinegary, you can use it but it's not rally sake anymore, it's rice wine vinegar. If you want, and if it's say half full, water it down and add a touch of cider vinegar to it. Cider vinegar isn't pasteurized so it will have live acetobacters in it and you can make your own vinegar. You need to cut the sake to half strength though otherwise it's too strong for the acetobacter to grow. </RelAText>

        <RelAText>Commercial pizza places usually use plastic dough proofing trays. They interlock and provide a relatively air-tight seal when they stack on top of each other. If you're looking for something that fits in your refrigerator, you should look into Artisan DoughMate trays. They are are 1/2 of the size of standard restaurant sized trays and you can fit a couple in your home fridge (Just under 18&quot; x 14&quot;) They stack with a very good air-tight seal and you just need a lid for the top one. You should be able to fit about six dough balls to a tray. If your only talking 2-3 dough balls then one tray would work, with a lid. But you also can look at aluminum dough pans. Some of these are also stackable with lids, and you put one dough ball into each one. I've often seen people spray the pans with oil so that the dough releases easily, or spray the dough balls so that if they spread into each other while proofing that don't make one massive dough ball. </RelAText>

        <RelAText>Try coating the dough ball with a little olive oil or a non-stick spray.  I don't know if that's the reason why but it's what I always do when baking bread and I never have a crust form during the rise. </RelAText>

        <RelAText>If you insist on using a damp cloth, you have to make it wet again and again, so this is quite cumbersome especially with long proofing times. Much easier is plastic wrap, which doesn't prevent the dough from rising if you use it to cover a sufficiently large bowl. Tightly wrapping the dough itself obviously won't work. My prefered method for these very long raises is a large food-safe plastic container with a lid. It doesn't have to be super-airtight and as I usually do a round of &quot;stretch and fold&quot; or quick punchdown every 12-24 hours I never had a problem with dried or overflowing dough.  </RelAText>

I did small batches to prevent waste. #1 was: 1 tbsp water 1 tsp white wine 1 tbsp cracked brown mustard seed 1 tbsp mustard powder (wait 10 minutes for heat reaction) 1 tbsp white vinegar 1 tsp grated horseradish salt #2 was: 2 tsp water 2 tsp white wine 1 tbsp cracked brown mustard seed 4 tsp mustard powder (wait 5 minutes for heat reaction) 1 tsp cider vinegar 1.5 tsp grated horseradish salt Both times, after about 6-12 hours in the fridge, they tasted like almost nothing. I got a bit of the horseradish heat, but very little of anything else. It was plenty thick, so it's not like a too high liquid / mustard ratio. I really just wanted to check here, but I have a strong suspicion that 12 hours is not long enough to wait to judge the true flavor. I've heard that it can take a few days for it to be good, but I've never read anything about what's bad about it right away (too hot, bitter, etc). Is that my only problem here or does my recipe need further tweaking? </OrgQBody>

        <RelQBody>I have bought a 3 liter deep fryer. There was a 1.5 liter one available too but I wanted a larger basket. This 3 liter deep fryer requires 2.5 liters oil minimum. I had no idea about this. This quantity seems too much.  Can I use less? Has anyone any idea what would happen if I use less than the recommended? If I cannot use less than the minimum what do I have to do to make it last longer? </RelQBody>

        <RelCText>If the company that puts out the fryer specifically says that 2.5 liters is required... is there a reason you think less would be OK? At the very least, we will need to know the brand and model of the one you have. There certainly may be some fryers that work with smaller amounts of oil but we can't tell you if yours is one of them if you don't tell us which fryer you have :)</RelCText>

        <RelAText>If you need a larger basket to fry the amount of food you want to cook, you need more oil as well. If you don't always want to make that much food (or use that much oil) then you need a smaller vessel for deep-frying, such as a second fryer or a small wok or kadai.  If you put less oil in than the minimum it may not cover the food and/or the oil could overheat, depending on how the fryer manages its temperature settings. Overheating oil can be dangerous and will also burn your food while leaving it raw inside. All around, something to avoid.  You can save and reuse frying oil. There are some good tips at the sites below. Let it cool fully then filter out food particles (I use coffee filters and a funnel for this; it can be a slow drain, be patient) Refrigerate used oil to retard bacterial growth  Stop using it if it looks weird or smells funny! http://www.seriouseats.com/2013/09/ask-the-food-lab-how-many-times-can-i-reuse-fry-oil.html http://extension.psu.edu/food/preservation/faq/questions-and-answers-about-re-using-frying-oil http://www.epicurious.com/expert-advice/you-can-reuse-frying-oil-article </RelAText>

        <RelAText>I'd dare say a small amount of oil can work if there is ample,controlled resupply of heat - why would it make much difference if it is coming from the vessel wall or more oil. However, I found that deep friers are just not designed for that, relying on the oil fill as thermal mass a lot... even or especially the small &quot;fondue&quot; style ones*. TL;DR for the rest of post: Advice on deep frying without using a fryer. Use at your own risk. You are better off with a chip pan/wok/pot and a thermometer for the kind of job where you just want to oil-blanch an ingredient and/or want to minimise oil usage because you do not want to reuse it (eg you want to fry tofu in fresh oil because it tends to be a magnet for the worst flavors it can get from old oil, you want to deep fry something with a strongly spiced and/or unruly rub/breading/batter on it, you want to fry ingredients like carrots or red bell pepper that will discolor the oil, you want to heat the oil very high initially to account for a temperature drop). The largest plate on even a normal electric hob is around 2000W - same as a medium sized home deep fryer, and pots and pans are optimized to transfer these 2000W to what is in them.  If you are not confident with open deep frying, have someone who is work with you for a while - yes it is hazardous, but manageably so - never leave the setup unattended. especially if no food in oil, monitor thermometer closely. always have something made of metal (nothing else) in reach that can cover the pot. always assume something can boil over. keep clutter away from your work area. use really high-heat oil - peanut, refined safflower, soy, rice bran; not some unspecified compound oil with a 180°C warning. be especially careful with induction, can heat a pot with small amounts of liquid in them alarmingly quick. keep the lid off as long as you are heating. if working on gas, ask someone who has experience in doing so for additional advice (overboiling into the burner is an obvious danger!), i'm electric... *the small ones that are partially plastic in construction - never managed to set a grease fire, but I think I would be far more at a loss to control one with these things than in a pot... </RelAText>

        <RelAText>I've used two different home-kitchen deep fryers over the last 18 years or so; one of them was essentially a kettle with a hidden heating element, and the other has a removable heating element that sits under the frying basket. The early one I used, the type with the hidden heating element, really has no minimum other than the basic rule-of-thumb that want at least 3x-4x the volume of oil to food being cooked, so that the oil doesn't cool down too quickly. The basket was the other factor, but if I remember correctly, my basket got pretty close to the bottom of the pan, so that wasn't a major consideration. A more serious model that I now use, which has a feature for filtering/draining oil, a more convincing thermostat, and electronic timers, has some more serious constraints, notably a minimum oil content of about 2.5 liters, and a maximum of maybe a tad over three liters. The minimum is pretty simple to explain: If you use less than 2.5 liters, none of the food will have enough room to float above the basket. You probably won't even cover the heating element without at least a liter of oil in there. Not covering the heating element has some serious consequences, namely the risk of the element glowing and eventually over-heating (based on the thermostat probe placement), oil spatter, and the more practical one of not being able to use the basket. The maximum fill line is an approximation designed to reduce the risk of oil boil-over. Having dealt with a oil boil-over on a friteuse meant for stovetop use in my starving student days in Germany, I can tell you the consequences are unpleasant. I had scars to prove it. High water content in some foods leads to furious bubbling, and if those bubbles manage to carry oil over the side of the pan, bad things happen. </RelAText>

          <RelACText>That was my thought, too -- I've seen way too many fryers where the basket stays an inch or two above the bottom, so a good deal of the oil is more heat-sync than actually coming into contact w/ the food.</RelACText>

        <RelAText>The whole point of deep frying is to use large amounts of oil. You don't want to just coat the food. You really need to have the food swim in a mass of oil much larger than the mass of the food. Else the food will cool down the oil locally and you won't get the desired crust.  So no, as long as you are using a large basket (which holds a large amount of food), you can't do proper deep frying with a small amount of oil. A consumer style deep fryer is probably already on the low side of the correct oil/food ratio.  </RelAText>

        <RelQBody>I have a favorite tried  true recipe that I simply call ‘foil potatoes’.  recipe link: http://www.evernote.com/shard/s1/sh/048c56cc-1481-48b2-89e6-88e897da651a/b0c036a6448b07e0a486f77acf2111cb This has been made multiple times with consistently good results. A few weeks ago I decided to try substituting the same quantity of home-made  greek-style yogurt in place of the whipping cream. They did not tenderize at all and although being fully cooked, were ‘crunchy’ and not desireable. As an experiment yesterday, I did another batch with part of it done with the original recipe using whipping cream,,  the rest with yogurt. All packets were done on the same grill side-by side with exactly the same time  temp. The packets with whipping cream were done perfectly  again the ones with yogurt were tough. My internet searches have not found any answers as to why this happened. In addition to wanting to understand the science of this difference, can anyone suggest changes I can make to have this substitution work? </RelQBody>

        <RelCText>Without seeing the recipe (permissions issue - it is not a public doc) it is hard to know if something else is going on, but at a minimum, the water content in cream is significantly higher than in Greek-style (strained) yogurt. I suspect that a non-strained yogurt would probably have a similar result to your cream version. You can also &quot;reconstitute&quot; strained yogurt by mixing water or milk in to give it a thinner texture which would also probably work. I doubt it is a chemical reaction, but the recipe would help.</RelCText>

        <RelAText>The amount of grease the meat exudes is dependent upon the amount of fat in the beef. If your beef is lean (10% fat), you will not likely notice a difference in the greasiness in the final product by not straining. If your meat is fatty (ground beef in the US can contain up to 30% fat), then the final product will have noticeable grease. The fat contributes in a good way (IMO) to the flavor and mouth-feel of chili if the meat is in the 15% range.  </RelAText>

        <RelCText>Have to suspect something about your cooking practices contributes to any issues you are having with PTFE. I did finally replace my 20 year old frying pan with a new one a few years back (as much for the new, thicker aluminum part as for a new cooking surface.) I don't use the PTFE for high-heat applications it's unsuited to, and I use non-metallic utensils appropriate for not scratching up the surface.

        <RelCText>Possibly, I have changed a few things over time. When I brown meat for the slow cooker, I now use cast iron. I've warped a few aluminum non sticks doing this because I add water to the pan to get the browning out to add to the roast.

I did small batches to prevent waste. #1 was: 1 tbsp water 1 tsp white wine 1 tbsp cracked brown mustard seed 1 tbsp mustard powder (wait 10 minutes for heat reaction) 1 tbsp white vinegar 1 tsp grated horseradish salt #2 was: 2 tsp water 2 tsp white wine 1 tbsp cracked brown mustard seed 4 tsp mustard powder (wait 5 minutes for heat reaction) 1 tsp cider vinegar 1.5 tsp grated horseradish salt Both times, after about 6-12 hours in the fridge, they tasted like almost nothing. I got a bit of the horseradish heat, but very little of anything else. It was plenty thick, so it's not like a too high liquid / mustard ratio. I really just wanted to check here, but I have a strong suspicion that 12 hours is not long enough to wait to judge the true flavor. I've heard that it can take a few days for it to be good, but I've never read anything about what's bad about it right away (too hot, bitter, etc). Is that my only problem here or does my recipe need further tweaking? </OrgQBody>

For ice cream/sorbet/gelato/frozen desserts, most &quot;sugar substitutes&quot; (low calorie sweeteners, etc) don't really work, as sugar plays an important structural role in how ice cream turns out.

        <RelAText>I find that the chemical and mechanical reactions between egg-white, egg-yolk and sugar is quite an delicate and complex one. I find that there is even a difference in using white refined cane sugar and white refined beet sugars when baking and the amount of effort of creaming eggs and sugar. Sugar substitutes that claim that they &quot;behave&quot; the same as sugar also don't seem to react in a manner that you'd expect. I would suggest that you try a range of sugars... The worse of them seems to be corn based sugars. The eggs just don't behave at all... </RelAText>

        <RelQSubject>Flavor in avocadoes gone forever?</RelQSubject>
        <RelQBody>I got some made-in-store supermarket guacamole yesterday and it was a new low in bland, watery, flavorless avocado meat. I have read that the reason modern avocadoes taste bland is because they use a variety called a &quot;Hass&quot; avocado that growers prefer because it is resistant to some kinds of blight and it does not spoil as readily as other varieties. Nevertheless, as someone who remembers as a boy getting avocadoes that tasted like, well, avocadoes and actually having good guacamole, it is really discouraging the world takeover of this tasteless drone avocado called the Hass. Also, it seems the Hass itself seems to be getting more bland and more watery year by year. Is there any way to get good avocado varieties of the old type that actually taste good, or have they gone the way of the Dodo? (I should mention that I grew up in San Diego, but now live in Massachusetts so this might be part of the problem; good avocadoes might only be available locally in Southern California.) Update By some further research I have found that apparently large numbers of avocadoes are being exported by Peru, and even though they are Hass avocadoes they are reputedly MUCH more bland than California avocadoes, but also much cheaper. So, this might be the problem, I am getting Peruvian avocadoes. </RelQBody>

        <RelCText>CA is in the midst of a drought. Haven't seen a good avocado from there all year.

        <RelCText>Good tropical fruit in Massachusetts is a rarity on all fronts. Picked underripe and shipped long distances does not ever compare well with picked at/near ripe from the farm up the road. Sometimes we see halfway decent Mexican or Florida avocados.

        <RelAText>You're exactly right in figuring out that part of the problem is having grown up with some of the world's best avocadoes, and then moving up North where decent avocadoes are scarce!  :)  Tasty avocadoes aren't all going the way of the dodo just yet, but you might have to move to Texas or Florida, or check some Mexican markets in your area, to get better avocadoes.  My husband lived in S Calif. as a child. He is an avocado connoisseur like you, as a result. Some of the best S Cali avocadoes are 'Fuerte' variety, which is more flavorful and creamier than Hass. We live in Texas and we get some very good, tasty Mexican avocadoes here- which by the way, are Hass.  But every single avocado I've brought home to hubby, whether from Mexico, Chile, Florida, Arizona, the Caribbean, Hawaii, Guatemala or Peru, ends up being compared unfavorably to those great S Calif. avocados he remembers. We visited a relative in the S Calif. area about 4.5 years ago and hubby had a delicious, fresh S Cali 'Fuerte' variety avocado during that trip--an avocado which he still recalls most fondly.  Personally I tried that same S Cali 'Fuerte' avocado too on that trip and while it was a bit tastier than the Hass avocadoes we currently get in Texas, I didn't find the flavor all THAT much better!  But hubby did prefer it a lot; he likes what he was raised on. Also his palate is more sensitive to bitterness than mine and 'Fuerte' is less bitter than Hass. In recent years, Calif. drought has made the delicious Cali avocadoes, especially the 'Fuerte', nearly impossible to get.  By the way- I lived in Illinois for a while. That state has the same avocado problem as Massachusetts: too far away from where good avocadoes and other tropical fruits are grown, to get avocadoes with decent quality. Whatever does survive the shipping journey that far North is usually picked much too green. Around the holidays such as Christmas and 16 de Septiembre and 5 de Mayo etc., there was ONE Mexican food store in Chicago that got some fresh, air-flown ripe Mexican avocadoes for sale just for these special days..at $5 each!   Mom who was raised in Texas was desperate for a good avocado because they are almost nonexistent in Chicago, so she bought 2 of those $5 avocados for Christmas dinner and said it was worth it. I had a small taste in my salad, it was great but geez $5 a piece LOL! I'm real glad we left Chicago and moved to Texas soon after that! I wouldn't count on S. California's avocado crop doing well anytime in the near future, as that area is likely to only have worse and worse water shortages and drought problems as time goes forward.  So perhaps, sadly, the 'Fuerte' avocadoes and the other delicious S Cali avocadoes you were raised on are going the way of the dodo. I hope not because they are very good avocadoes and it's always nice to be able to get USA grown tropical fruits. But unless some amazing advances in water and climate management are made to save the Cali avocado farms from extinction, your delicious S Cali grown avocadoes may become nothing more than a fond memory. </RelAText>

        <RelAText>If you have room to place the Wellingtons on the same shelf, you simply cook them in the same way as you would a single one. Conventional ovens do not work like microwaves - the amount of stuff in the oven makes no difference, providing air flow is maintained and you don't have something large right up at the top or bottom blocking an element. Fan ovens are especially useful as they actively circulate the heat around the oven cavity, so you can cook things on two different levels with fairly good consistency. </RelAText>

        <RelAText>I recon it has formed like a cake after cooling. The best option you have is to take a big chunk of it in a microwaveable container (making sure that you are not breaking the rice grains) and sprinkling with some water. Then cover with a cling film and microwave for 3-4 minutes from cold. Your rice grains will separate because of the extra moisture from the sprinkled water and the Pulao will become slightly moist.   But yes, Pulao is a dry dish and needs to be eaten with a side like Raita or Salan. </RelAText>

        <RelAText>Pulao is usually a &quot;dry&quot; dish without any gravy/sauce left in it when it finishes cooking. If the rice seems to be fully cooked and the individual grains do not seem to be under cooked or slightly crunchy then I think it is probably correct.  Many people serve raita (I like a simple yoghurt-onion-tomato mix with some chili powder and salt) and green coriander chutney along with pulao or biryani which helps to make the overall experience less dry. I usually cook the marinade as well to make a gravy/salan to serve on the side when I make chicken biryani. </RelAText>

        <RelAText>Unless contaminated by, say, drinking straight out of the bottle, it will likely be safe to consume, but it will probably have deteriorated in quality. Sake which is no longer appealing to drink may be suitable for use in cooking; if you're not accustomed to cooking with sake, consider something simple, like potatoes simmered with a modest amount of water, sake, salt  pepper, soy sauce and butter. Low-alcohol beverages, whether fermented or slightly fortified, tend to deteriorate in quality over time, although they will become stale less slowly if their containers are sealed airtight and chilled. Port, marsala, sherry, vermouth, wine and sake all typically best consumed within a short time after opening, although the specific chemistry may vary. Some folks consider a sake that's been open, unrefrigerated, for more than a few weeks undrinkable. I don't know if I'm that rigid, but it's a good benchmark. I've seen certain sakes do ok for a few months in the refrigerator. </RelAText>

        <RelAText>It will keep until it doesn't. Eventually it will spoil, but because sake is considerably above the magic number for alcohol concentration to be self preserving when sealed (&gt;12.3% alcohol by volume), so long as you don't let any alcohol tolerant microbes into the bottle, then it will be fine. Smell it first,'if it smells earthy, throw it out, if it smells vinegary, you can use it but it's not rally sake anymore, it's rice wine vinegar. If you want, and if it's say half full, water it down and add a touch of cider vinegar to it. Cider vinegar isn't pasteurized so it will have live acetobacters in it and you can make your own vinegar. You need to cut the sake to half strength though otherwise it's too strong for the acetobacter to grow. </RelAText>

        <RelAText>Commercial pizza places usually use plastic dough proofing trays. They interlock and provide a relatively air-tight seal when they stack on top of each other. If you're looking for something that fits in your refrigerator, you should look into Artisan DoughMate trays. They are are 1/2 of the size of standard restaurant sized trays and you can fit a couple in your home fridge (Just under 18&quot; x 14&quot;) They stack with a very good air-tight seal and you just need a lid for the top one. You should be able to fit about six dough balls to a tray. If your only talking 2-3 dough balls then one tray would work, with a lid. But you also can look at aluminum dough pans. Some of these are also stackable with lids, and you put one dough ball into each one. I've often seen people spray the pans with oil so that the dough releases easily, or spray the dough balls so that if they spread into each other while proofing that don't make one massive dough ball. </RelAText>

        <RelAText>Try coating the dough ball with a little olive oil or a non-stick spray.  I don't know if that's the reason why but it's what I always do when baking bread and I never have a crust form during the rise. </RelAText>

        <RelAText>If you insist on using a damp cloth, you have to make it wet again and again, so this is quite cumbersome especially with long proofing times. Much easier is plastic wrap, which doesn't prevent the dough from rising if you use it to cover a sufficiently large bowl. Tightly wrapping the dough itself obviously won't work. My prefered method for these very long raises is a large food-safe plastic container with a lid. It doesn't have to be super-airtight and as I usually do a round of &quot;stretch and fold&quot; or quick punchdown every 12-24 hours I never had a problem with dried or overflowing dough.  </RelAText>

        <RelCText>If the company that puts out the fryer specifically says that 2.5 liters is required... is there a reason you think less would be OK? At the very least, we will need to know the brand and model of the one you have.

        <RelAText>If you need a larger basket to fry the amount of food you want to cook, you need more oil as well. If you don't always want to make that much food (or use that much oil) then you need a smaller vessel for deep-frying, such as a second fryer or a small wok or kadai.  If you put less oil in than the minimum it may not cover the food and/or the oil could overheat, depending on how the fryer manages its temperature settings. Overheating oil can be dangerous and will also burn your food while leaving it raw inside. All around, something to avoid.  You can save and reuse frying oil. There are some good tips at the sites below. Let it cool fully then filter out food particles (I use coffee filters and a funnel for this; it can be a slow drain, be patient) Refrigerate used oil to retard bacterial growth  Stop using it if it looks weird or smells funny! http://www.seriouseats.com/2013/09/ask-the-food-lab-how-many-times-can-i-reuse-fry-oil.html http://extension.psu.edu/food/preservation/faq/questions-and-answers-about-re-using-frying-oil http://www.epicurious.com/expert-advice/you-can-reuse-frying-oil-article </RelAText>

        <RelAText>I'd dare say a small amount of oil can work if there is ample,controlled resupply of heat - why would it make much difference if it is coming from the vessel wall or more oil. However, I found that deep friers are just not designed for that, relying on the oil fill as thermal mass a lot... even or especially the small &quot;fondue&quot; style ones*. TL;DR for the rest of post: Advice on deep frying without using a fryer. Use at your own risk. You are better off with a chip pan/wok/pot and a thermometer for the kind of job where you just want to oil-blanch an ingredient and/or want to minimise oil usage because you do not want to reuse it (eg you want to fry tofu in fresh oil because it tends to be a magnet for the worst flavors it can get from old oil, you want to deep fry something with a strongly spiced and/or unruly rub/breading/batter on it, you want to fry ingredients like carrots or red bell pepper that will discolor the oil, you want to heat the oil very high initially to account for a temperature drop). The largest plate on even a normal electric hob is around 2000W - same as a medium sized home deep fryer, and pots and pans are optimized to transfer these 2000W to what is in them.  If you are not confident with open deep frying, have someone who is work with you for a while - yes it is hazardous, but manageably so - never leave the setup unattended. especially if no food in oil, monitor thermometer closely. always have something made of metal (nothing else) in reach that can cover the pot. always assume something can boil over. keep clutter away from your work area. use really high-heat oil - peanut, refined safflower, soy, rice bran; not some unspecified compound oil with a 180°C warning. be especially careful with induction, can heat a pot with small amounts of liquid in them alarmingly quick. keep the lid off as long as you are heating. if working on gas, ask someone who has experience in doing so for additional advice (overboiling into the burner is an obvious danger!), i'm electric... *the small ones that are partially plastic in construction - never managed to set a grease fire, but I think I would be far more at a loss to control one with these things than in a pot... </RelAText>

        <RelAText>I've used two different home-kitchen deep fryers over the last 18 years or so; one of them was essentially a kettle with a hidden heating element, and the other has a removable heating element that sits under the frying basket. The early one I used, the type with the hidden heating element, really has no minimum other than the basic rule-of-thumb that want at least 3x-4x the volume of oil to food being cooked, so that the oil doesn't cool down too quickly. The basket was the other factor, but if I remember correctly, my basket got pretty close to the bottom of the pan, so that wasn't a major consideration. A more serious model that I now use, which has a feature for filtering/draining oil, a more convincing thermostat, and electronic timers, has some more serious constraints, notably a minimum oil content of about 2.5 liters, and a maximum of maybe a tad over three liters. The minimum is pretty simple to explain: If you use less than 2.5 liters, none of the food will have enough room to float above the basket. You probably won't even cover the heating element without at least a liter of oil in there. Not covering the heating element has some serious consequences, namely the risk of the element glowing and eventually over-heating (based on the thermostat probe placement), oil spatter, and the more practical one of not being able to use the basket. The maximum fill line is an approximation designed to reduce the risk of oil boil-over. Having dealt with a oil boil-over on a friteuse meant for stovetop use in my starving student days in Germany, I can tell you the consequences are unpleasant. I had scars to prove it. High water content in some foods leads to furious bubbling, and if those bubbles manage to carry oil over the side of the pan, bad things happen. </RelAText>

          <RelACText>That was my thought, too -- I've seen way too many fryers where the basket stays an inch or two above the bottom, so a good deal of the oil is more heat-sync than actually coming into contact w/ the food.</RelACText>

        <RelAText>The whole point of deep frying is to use large amounts of oil. You don't want to just coat the food. You really need to have the food swim in a mass of oil much larger than the mass of the food. Else the food will cool down the oil locally and you won't get the desired crust.  So no, as long as you are using a large basket (which holds a large amount of food), you can't do proper deep frying with a small amount of oil. A consumer style deep fryer is probably already on the low side of the correct oil/food ratio.  </RelAText>

A few weeks ago I decided to try substituting the same quantity of home-made  greek-style yogurt in place of the whipping cream. They did not tenderize at all and although being fully cooked, were ‘crunchy’ and not desireable. As an experiment yesterday, I did another batch with part of it done with the original recipe using whipping cream,,  the rest with yogurt. All packets were done on the same grill side-by side with exactly the same time  temp. The packets with whipping cream were done perfectly  again the ones with yogurt were tough. My internet searches have not found any answers as to why this happened. In addition to wanting to understand the science of this difference, can anyone suggest changes I can make to have this substitution work? </RelQBody>

        <RelCText>Without seeing the recipe (permissions issue - it is not a public doc) it is hard to know if something else is going on, but at a minimum, the water content in cream is significantly higher than in Greek-style (strained) yogurt. I suspect that a non-strained yogurt would probably have a similar result to your cream version. You can also &quot;reconstitute&quot; strained yogurt by mixing water or milk in to give it a thinner texture which would also probably work. I doubt it is a chemical reaction, but the recipe would help.</RelCText>

        <RelAText>The amount of grease the meat exudes is dependent upon the amount of fat in the beef. If your beef is lean (10% fat), you will not likely notice a difference in the greasiness in the final product by not straining. If your meat is fatty (ground beef in the US can contain up to 30% fat), then the final product will have noticeable grease. The fat contributes in a good way (IMO) to the flavor and mouth-feel of chili if the meat is in the 15% range.  </RelAText>

        <RelCText>Have to suspect something about your cooking practices contributes to any issues you are having with PTFE. I did finally replace my 20 year old frying pan with a new one a few years back (as much for the new, thicker aluminum part as for a new cooking surface.)

        <RelCText>Possibly, I have changed a few things over time. When I brown meat for the slow cooker, I now use cast iron. I've warped a few aluminum non sticks doing this because I add water to the pan to get the browning out to add to the roast.

For ice cream/sorbet/gelato/frozen desserts, most &quot;sugar substitutes&quot; (low calorie sweeteners, etc) don't really work, as sugar plays an important structural role in how ice cream turns out.

        <RelAText>I find that the chemical and mechanical reactions between egg-white, egg-yolk and sugar is quite an delicate and complex one. I find that there is even a difference in using white refined cane sugar and white refined beet sugars when baking and the amount of effort of creaming eggs and sugar. Sugar substitutes that claim that they &quot;behave&quot; the same as sugar also don't seem to react in a manner that you'd expect. I would suggest that you try a range of sugars... The worse of them seems to be corn based sugars. The eggs just don't behave at all... </RelAText>

        <RelQSubject>Flavor in avocadoes gone forever?</RelQSubject>
        <RelQBody>I got some made-in-store supermarket guacamole yesterday and it was a new low in bland, watery, flavorless avocado meat. I have read that the reason modern avocadoes taste bland is because they use a variety called a &quot;Hass&quot; avocado that growers prefer because it is resistant to some kinds of blight and it does not spoil as readily as other varieties. Nevertheless, as someone who remembers as a boy getting avocadoes that tasted like, well, avocadoes and actually having good guacamole, it is really discouraging the world takeover of this tasteless drone avocado called the Hass. Also, it seems the Hass itself seems to be getting more bland and more watery year by year. Is there any way to get good avocado varieties of the old type that actually taste good, or have they gone the way of the Dodo? (I should mention that I grew up in San Diego, but now live in Massachusetts so this might be part of the problem; good avocadoes might only be available locally in Southern California.) Update By some further research I have found that apparently large numbers of avocadoes are being exported by Peru, and even though they are Hass avocadoes they are reputedly MUCH more bland than California avocadoes, but also much cheaper. So, this might be the problem, I am getting Peruvian avocadoes. </RelQBody>

        <RelCText>CA is in the midst of a drought. Haven't seen a good avocado from there all year.

        <RelCText>Good tropical fruit in Massachusetts is a rarity on all fronts. Picked underripe and shipped long distances does not ever compare well with picked at/near ripe from the farm up the road. Sometimes we see halfway decent Mexican or Florida avocados.

        <RelAText>You're exactly right in figuring out that part of the problem is having grown up with some of the world's best avocadoes, and then moving up North where decent avocadoes are scarce!  :)  Tasty avocadoes aren't all going the way of the dodo just yet, but you might have to move to Texas or Florida, or check some Mexican markets in your area, to get better avocadoes.  My husband lived in S Calif. as a child. He is an avocado connoisseur like you, as a result. Some of the best S Cali avocadoes are 'Fuerte' variety, which is more flavorful and creamier than Hass. We live in Texas and we get some very good, tasty Mexican avocadoes here- which by the way, are Hass.  But every single avocado I've brought home to hubby, whether from Mexico, Chile, Florida, Arizona, the Caribbean, Hawaii, Guatemala or Peru, ends up being compared unfavorably to those great S Calif. avocados he remembers. We visited a relative in the S Calif. area about 4.5 years ago and hubby had a delicious, fresh S Cali 'Fuerte' variety avocado during that trip--an avocado which he still recalls most fondly.  Personally I tried that same S Cali 'Fuerte' avocado too on that trip and while it was a bit tastier than the Hass avocadoes we currently get in Texas, I didn't find the flavor all THAT much better!  But hubby did prefer it a lot; he likes what he was raised on. Also his palate is more sensitive to bitterness than mine and 'Fuerte' is less bitter than Hass. In recent years, Calif. drought has made the delicious Cali avocadoes, especially the 'Fuerte', nearly impossible to get.  By the way- I lived in Illinois for a while. That state has the same avocado problem as Massachusetts: too far away from where good avocadoes and other tropical fruits are grown, to get avocadoes with decent quality. Whatever does survive the shipping journey that far North is usually picked much too green. Around the holidays such as Christmas and 16 de Septiembre and 5 de Mayo etc., there was ONE Mexican food store in Chicago that got some fresh, air-flown ripe Mexican avocadoes for sale just for these special days..at $5 each!   Mom who was raised in Texas was desperate for a good avocado because they are almost nonexistent in Chicago, so she bought 2 of those $5 avocados for Christmas dinner and said it was worth it. I had a small taste in my salad, it was great but geez $5 a piece LOL! I'm real glad we left Chicago and moved to Texas soon after that! I wouldn't count on S. California's avocado crop doing well anytime in the near future, as that area is likely to only have worse and worse water shortages and drought problems as time goes forward.  So perhaps, sadly, the 'Fuerte' avocadoes and the other delicious S Cali avocadoes you were raised on are going the way of the dodo. I hope not because they are very good avocadoes and it's always nice to be able to get USA grown tropical fruits. But unless some amazing advances in water and climate management are made to save the Cali avocado farms from extinction, your delicious S Cali grown avocadoes may become nothing more than a fond memory. </RelAText>

    <OrgQSubject>Chemistry of different brands of baking powder</OrgQSubject>
    <OrgQBody>The Clabber Girl FAQs say:   Rumford Baking Powder's reaction is approximately 70% with moisture (or in the bowl) and the rest when heat is applied. Clabber Girl's reaction is approximately 40% with moisture and the rest when heat is applied. So Rumford and Clabber Girl aren't chemically the same.  My first question is,   Can anyone say what the chemical difference between the two is? I understand that a double-acting baking powder has a base, two acids, and filler.  The base will react with one of the acids at low temperature, creating carbon dioxide bubbles when I mix my batter.  It reacts with the other acid at high temperature, creating carbon dioxide bubbles when my batter is in the oven.  What I think the above FAQ is saying is that Rumford has a 70/30 split between acids that react at low temperatures and high temperatures, while Clabber Girl has a 40/60 split.  But I don't know what chemicals the two baking powders are formulated with, and I don't know how the split between the two acids is being measured (volume? weight?), so I don't know how much carbon dioxide they generate during each reaction.  That leads me to my second question,   Is there a practical difference between different brands of baking powder, or are they all formulated so that they function the same? It could be the case that the two baking powders are formulated so that Rumford and Clabber Girl release carbon dioxide in the same proportions in their first and second reactions.  This seems possible to me. There's another possible way in which two baking powders could differ.  Most recipes specify volumes (like &quot;1 tsp&quot;).  They assume it doesn't matter whether you're using Rumford or Clabber Girl or anything else.  But even if two baking powders release carbon dioxide in the same proportions in the two reactions, they may not release the same total amount of carbon dioxide.  A teaspoon of one might release more carbon dioxide than a teaspoon of the other.  A manufacturer can control how much carbon dioxide gets released per unit volume by adding filler, which leads me to my third question,   Is one of the purposes of filler to make sure that the amount of carbon dioxide per unit of baking powder is the same between different brands of baking powder? </OrgQBody>

        <RelAText>If you have room to place the Wellingtons on the same shelf, you simply cook them in the same way as you would a single one. Conventional ovens do not work like microwaves - the amount of stuff in the oven makes no difference, providing air flow is maintained and you don't have something large right up at the top or bottom blocking an element. Fan ovens are especially useful as they actively circulate the heat around the oven cavity, so you can cook things on two different levels with fairly good consistency. </RelAText>

        <RelAText>I recon it has formed like a cake after cooling. The best option you have is to take a big chunk of it in a microwaveable container (making sure that you are not breaking the rice grains) and sprinkling with some water. Then cover with a cling film and microwave for 3-4 minutes from cold. Your rice grains will separate because of the extra moisture from the sprinkled water and the Pulao will become slightly moist.   But yes, Pulao is a dry dish and needs to be eaten with a side like Raita or Salan. </RelAText>

        <RelAText>Pulao is usually a &quot;dry&quot; dish without any gravy/sauce left in it when it finishes cooking. If the rice seems to be fully cooked and the individual grains do not seem to be under cooked or slightly crunchy then I think it is probably correct.  Many people serve raita (I like a simple yoghurt-onion-tomato mix with some chili powder and salt) and green coriander chutney along with pulao or biryani which helps to make the overall experience less dry. I usually cook the marinade as well to make a gravy/salan to serve on the side when I make chicken biryani. </RelAText>

        <RelAText>Unless contaminated by, say, drinking straight out of the bottle, it will likely be safe to consume, but it will probably have deteriorated in quality. Sake which is no longer appealing to drink may be suitable for use in cooking; if you're not accustomed to cooking with sake, consider something simple, like potatoes simmered with a modest amount of water, sake, salt  pepper, soy sauce and butter. Low-alcohol beverages, whether fermented or slightly fortified, tend to deteriorate in quality over time, although they will become stale less slowly if their containers are sealed airtight and chilled. Port, marsala, sherry, vermouth, wine and sake all typically best consumed within a short time after opening, although the specific chemistry may vary. Some folks consider a sake that's been open, unrefrigerated, for more than a few weeks undrinkable. I don't know if I'm that rigid, but it's a good benchmark. I've seen certain sakes do ok for a few months in the refrigerator. </RelAText>

        <RelAText>It will keep until it doesn't. Eventually it will spoil, but because sake is considerably above the magic number for alcohol concentration to be self preserving when sealed (&gt;12.3% alcohol by volume), so long as you don't let any alcohol tolerant microbes into the bottle, then it will be fine. Smell it first,'if it smells earthy, throw it out, if it smells vinegary, you can use it but it's not rally sake anymore, it's rice wine vinegar. If you want, and if it's say half full, water it down and add a touch of cider vinegar to it. Cider vinegar isn't pasteurized so it will have live acetobacters in it and you can make your own vinegar. You need to cut the sake to half strength though otherwise it's too strong for the acetobacter to grow. </RelAText>

        <RelAText>Commercial pizza places usually use plastic dough proofing trays. They interlock and provide a relatively air-tight seal when they stack on top of each other. If you're looking for something that fits in your refrigerator, you should look into Artisan DoughMate trays. They are are 1/2 of the size of standard restaurant sized trays and you can fit a couple in your home fridge (Just under 18&quot; x 14&quot;) They stack with a very good air-tight seal and you just need a lid for the top one. You should be able to fit about six dough balls to a tray. If your only talking 2-3 dough balls then one tray would work, with a lid. But you also can look at aluminum dough pans. Some of these are also stackable with lids, and you put one dough ball into each one. I've often seen people spray the pans with oil so that the dough releases easily, or spray the dough balls so that if they spread into each other while proofing that don't make one massive dough ball. </RelAText>

        <RelAText>Try coating the dough ball with a little olive oil or a non-stick spray.  I don't know if that's the reason why but it's what I always do when baking bread and I never have a crust form during the rise. </RelAText>

        <RelAText>If you insist on using a damp cloth, you have to make it wet again and again, so this is quite cumbersome especially with long proofing times. Much easier is plastic wrap, which doesn't prevent the dough from rising if you use it to cover a sufficiently large bowl. Tightly wrapping the dough itself obviously won't work. My prefered method for these very long raises is a large food-safe plastic container with a lid. It doesn't have to be super-airtight and as I usually do a round of &quot;stretch and fold&quot; or quick punchdown every 12-24 hours I never had a problem with dried or overflowing dough.  </RelAText>

        <RelAText>If you need a larger basket to fry the amount of food you want to cook, you need more oil as well. If you don't always want to make that much food (or use that much oil) then you need a smaller vessel for deep-frying, such as a second fryer or a small wok or kadai.  If you put less oil in than the minimum it may not cover the food and/or the oil could overheat, depending on how the fryer manages its temperature settings. Overheating oil can be dangerous and will also burn your food while leaving it raw inside. All around, something to avoid.  You can save and reuse frying oil. There are some good tips at the sites below. Let it cool fully then filter out food particles (I use coffee filters and a funnel for this; it can be a slow drain, be patient) Refrigerate used oil to retard bacterial growth  Stop using it if it looks weird or smells funny! http://www.seriouseats.com/2013/09/ask-the-food-lab-how-many-times-can-i-reuse-fry-oil.html http://extension.psu.edu/food/preservation/faq/questions-and-answers-about-re-using-frying-oil http://www.epicurious.com/expert-advice/you-can-reuse-frying-oil-article </RelAText>

        <RelAText>I'd dare say a small amount of oil can work if there is ample,controlled resupply of heat - why would it make much difference if it is coming from the vessel wall or more oil. However, I found that deep friers are just not designed for that, relying on the oil fill as thermal mass a lot... even or especially the small &quot;fondue&quot; style ones*. TL;DR for the rest of post: Advice on deep frying without using a fryer. Use at your own risk. You are better off with a chip pan/wok/pot and a thermometer for the kind of job where you just want to oil-blanch an ingredient and/or want to minimise oil usage because you do not want to reuse it (eg you want to fry tofu in fresh oil because it tends to be a magnet for the worst flavors it can get from old oil, you want to deep fry something with a strongly spiced and/or unruly rub/breading/batter on it, you want to fry ingredients like carrots or red bell pepper that will discolor the oil, you want to heat the oil very high initially to account for a temperature drop). The largest plate on even a normal electric hob is around 2000W - same as a medium sized home deep fryer, and pots and pans are optimized to transfer these 2000W to what is in them.  If you are not confident with open deep frying, have someone who is work with you for a while - yes it is hazardous, but manageably so - never leave the setup unattended. especially if no food in oil, monitor thermometer closely. always have something made of metal (nothing else) in reach that can cover the pot. always assume something can boil over. keep clutter away from your work area. use really high-heat oil - peanut, refined safflower, soy, rice bran; not some unspecified compound oil with a 180°C warning. be especially careful with induction, can heat a pot with small amounts of liquid in them alarmingly quick. keep the lid off as long as you are heating. if working on gas, ask someone who has experience in doing so for additional advice (overboiling into the burner is an obvious danger!), i'm electric... *the small ones that are partially plastic in construction - never managed to set a grease fire, but I think I would be far more at a loss to control one with these things than in a pot... </RelAText>

        <RelAText>I've used two different home-kitchen deep fryers over the last 18 years or so; one of them was essentially a kettle with a hidden heating element, and the other has a removable heating element that sits under the frying basket. The early one I used, the type with the hidden heating element, really has no minimum other than the basic rule-of-thumb that want at least 3x-4x the volume of oil to food being cooked, so that the oil doesn't cool down too quickly. The basket was the other factor, but if I remember correctly, my basket got pretty close to the bottom of the pan, so that wasn't a major consideration. A more serious model that I now use, which has a feature for filtering/draining oil, a more convincing thermostat, and electronic timers, has some more serious constraints, notably a minimum oil content of about 2.5 liters, and a maximum of maybe a tad over three liters. The minimum is pretty simple to explain: If you use less than 2.5 liters, none of the food will have enough room to float above the basket. You probably won't even cover the heating element without at least a liter of oil in there. Not covering the heating element has some serious consequences, namely the risk of the element glowing and eventually over-heating (based on the thermostat probe placement), oil spatter, and the more practical one of not being able to use the basket. The maximum fill line is an approximation designed to reduce the risk of oil boil-over. Having dealt with a oil boil-over on a friteuse meant for stovetop use in my starving student days in Germany, I can tell you the consequences are unpleasant. I had scars to prove it. High water content in some foods leads to furious bubbling, and if those bubbles manage to carry oil over the side of the pan, bad things happen. </RelAText>

          <RelACText>That was my thought, too -- I've seen way too many fryers where the basket stays an inch or two above the bottom, so a good deal of the oil is more heat-sync than actually coming into contact w/ the food.</RelACText>

        <RelAText>The whole point of deep frying is to use large amounts of oil. You don't want to just coat the food. You really need to have the food swim in a mass of oil much larger than the mass of the food. Else the food will cool down the oil locally and you won't get the desired crust.  So no, as long as you are using a large basket (which holds a large amount of food), you can't do proper deep frying with a small amount of oil. A consumer style deep fryer is probably already on the low side of the correct oil/food ratio.  </RelAText>

        <RelQSubject>In a recipe, yogurt toughens potatoes but whipping cream does not</RelQSubject>
        <RelQBody>I have a favorite tried  true recipe that I simply call ‘foil potatoes’.  recipe link: http://www.evernote.com/shard/s1/sh/048c56cc-1481-48b2-89e6-88e897da651a/b0c036a6448b07e0a486f77acf2111cb This has been made multiple times with consistently good results. A few weeks ago I decided to try substituting the same quantity of home-made  greek-style yogurt in place of the whipping cream. They did not tenderize at all and although being fully cooked, were ‘crunchy’ and not desireable. As an experiment yesterday, I did another batch with part of it done with the original recipe using whipping cream,,  the rest with yogurt. All packets were done on the same grill side-by side with exactly the same time  temp. The packets with whipping cream were done perfectly  again the ones with yogurt were tough. My internet searches have not found any answers as to why this happened. In addition to wanting to understand the science of this difference, can anyone suggest changes I can make to have this substitution work? </RelQBody>

        <RelCText>Without seeing the recipe (permissions issue - it is not a public doc) it is hard to know if something else is going on, but at a minimum, the water content in cream is significantly higher than in Greek-style (strained) yogurt. I suspect that a non-strained yogurt would probably have a similar result to your cream version. You can also &quot;reconstitute&quot; strained yogurt by mixing water or milk in to give it a thinner texture which would also probably work. I doubt it is a chemical reaction, but the recipe would help.</RelCText>

        <RelAText>The amount of grease the meat exudes is dependent upon the amount of fat in the beef. If your beef is lean (10% fat), you will not likely notice a difference in the greasiness in the final product by not straining. If your meat is fatty (ground beef in the US can contain up to 30% fat), then the final product will have noticeable grease. The fat contributes in a good way (IMO) to the flavor and mouth-feel of chili if the meat is in the 15% range.  </RelAText>

        <RelCText>Have to suspect something about your cooking practices contributes to any issues you are having with PTFE. I did finally replace my 20 year old frying pan with a new one a few years back (as much for the new, thicker aluminum part as for a new cooking surface.) I don't use the PTFE for high-heat applications it's unsuited to, and I use non-metallic utensils appropriate for not scratching up the surface. OTOH, the iron skillet I went off to college with is still going strong, but I use them for different things...</RelCText>

        <RelCText>Possibly, I have changed a few things over time. When I brown meat for the slow cooker, I now use cast iron. I've warped a few aluminum non sticks doing this because I add water to the pan to get the browning out to add to the roast. Other than that it seems that most frying pans just wont stay flat and tend to shed their coatings withing 5 or 6 years.</RelCText>

I find that there is even a difference in using white refined cane sugar and white refined beet sugars when baking and the amount of effort of creaming eggs and sugar. Sugar substitutes that claim that they &quot;behave&quot; the same as sugar also don't seem to react in a manner that you'd expect. I would suggest that you try a range of sugars...

        <RelQSubject>Flavor in avocadoes gone forever?</RelQSubject>
        <RelQBody>I got some made-in-store supermarket guacamole yesterday and it was a new low in bland, watery, flavorless avocado meat. I have read that the reason modern avocadoes taste bland is because they use a variety called a &quot;Hass&quot; avocado that growers prefer because it is resistant to some kinds of blight and it does not spoil as readily as other varieties. Nevertheless, as someone who remembers as a boy getting avocadoes that tasted like, well, avocadoes and actually having good guacamole, it is really discouraging the world takeover of this tasteless drone avocado called the Hass. Also, it seems the Hass itself seems to be getting more bland and more watery year by year. Is there any way to get good avocado varieties of the old type that actually taste good, or have they gone the way of the Dodo? (I should mention that I grew up in San Diego, but now live in Massachusetts so this might be part of the problem; good avocadoes might only be available locally in Southern California.) Update By some further research I have found that apparently large numbers of avocadoes are being exported by Peru, and even though they are Hass avocadoes they are reputedly MUCH more bland than California avocadoes, but also much cheaper. So, this might be the problem, I am getting Peruvian avocadoes. </RelQBody>

        <RelCText>CA is in the midst of a drought. Haven't seen a good avocado from there all year.

        <RelCText>Good tropical fruit in Massachusetts is a rarity on all fronts. Picked underripe and shipped long distances does not ever compare well with picked at/near ripe from the farm up the road. Sometimes we see halfway decent Mexican or Florida avocados. Halfway decent is about as good as it gets.</RelCText>

        <RelAText>You're exactly right in figuring out that part of the problem is having grown up with some of the world's best avocadoes, and then moving up North where decent avocadoes are scarce!  :)  Tasty avocadoes aren't all going the way of the dodo just yet, but you might have to move to Texas or Florida, or check some Mexican markets in your area, to get better avocadoes.  My husband lived in S Calif. as a child. He is an avocado connoisseur like you, as a result. Some of the best S Cali avocadoes are 'Fuerte' variety, which is more flavorful and creamier than Hass. We live in Texas and we get some very good, tasty Mexican avocadoes here- which by the way, are Hass.  But every single avocado I've brought home to hubby, whether from Mexico, Chile, Florida, Arizona, the Caribbean, Hawaii, Guatemala or Peru, ends up being compared unfavorably to those great S Calif. avocados he remembers. We visited a relative in the S Calif. area about 4.5 years ago and hubby had a delicious, fresh S Cali 'Fuerte' variety avocado during that trip--an avocado which he still recalls most fondly.  Personally I tried that same S Cali 'Fuerte' avocado too on that trip and while it was a bit tastier than the Hass avocadoes we currently get in Texas, I didn't find the flavor all THAT much better!  But hubby did prefer it a lot; he likes what he was raised on. Also his palate is more sensitive to bitterness than mine and 'Fuerte' is less bitter than Hass. In recent years, Calif. drought has made the delicious Cali avocadoes, especially the 'Fuerte', nearly impossible to get.  By the way- I lived in Illinois for a while. That state has the same avocado problem as Massachusetts: too far away from where good avocadoes and other tropical fruits are grown, to get avocadoes with decent quality. Whatever does survive the shipping journey that far North is usually picked much too green. Around the holidays such as Christmas and 16 de Septiembre and 5 de Mayo etc., there was ONE Mexican food store in Chicago that got some fresh, air-flown ripe Mexican avocadoes for sale just for these special days..at $5 each!   Mom who was raised in Texas was desperate for a good avocado because they are almost nonexistent in Chicago, so she bought 2 of those $5 avocados for Christmas dinner and said it was worth it. I had a small taste in my salad, it was great but geez $5 a piece LOL! I'm real glad we left Chicago and moved to Texas soon after that! I wouldn't count on S. California's avocado crop doing well anytime in the near future, as that area is likely to only have worse and worse water shortages and drought problems as time goes forward.  So perhaps, sadly, the 'Fuerte' avocadoes and the other delicious S Cali avocadoes you were raised on are going the way of the dodo. I hope not because they are very good avocadoes and it's always nice to be able to get USA grown tropical fruits. But unless some amazing advances in water and climate management are made to save the Cali avocado farms from extinction, your delicious S Cali grown avocadoes may become nothing more than a fond memory. </RelAText>

        <RelAText>If you have room to place the Wellingtons on the same shelf, you simply cook them in the same way as you would a single one. Conventional ovens do not work like microwaves - the amount of stuff in the oven makes no difference, providing air flow is maintained and you don't have something large right up at the top or bottom blocking an element. Fan ovens are especially useful as they actively circulate the heat around the oven cavity, so you can cook things on two different levels with fairly good consistency. </RelAText>

        <RelAText>I recon it has formed like a cake after cooling. The best option you have is to take a big chunk of it in a microwaveable container (making sure that you are not breaking the rice grains) and sprinkling with some water. Then cover with a cling film and microwave for 3-4 minutes from cold. Your rice grains will separate because of the extra moisture from the sprinkled water and the Pulao will become slightly moist.   But yes, Pulao is a dry dish and needs to be eaten with a side like Raita or Salan. </RelAText>

        <RelAText>Pulao is usually a &quot;dry&quot; dish without any gravy/sauce left in it when it finishes cooking. If the rice seems to be fully cooked and the individual grains do not seem to be under cooked or slightly crunchy then I think it is probably correct.  Many people serve raita (I like a simple yoghurt-onion-tomato mix with some chili powder and salt) and green coriander chutney along with pulao or biryani which helps to make the overall experience less dry. I usually cook the marinade as well to make a gravy/salan to serve on the side when I make chicken biryani. </RelAText>

        <RelAText>Unless contaminated by, say, drinking straight out of the bottle, it will likely be safe to consume, but it will probably have deteriorated in quality. Sake which is no longer appealing to drink may be suitable for use in cooking; if you're not accustomed to cooking with sake, consider something simple, like potatoes simmered with a modest amount of water, sake, salt  pepper, soy sauce and butter. Low-alcohol beverages, whether fermented or slightly fortified, tend to deteriorate in quality over time, although they will become stale less slowly if their containers are sealed airtight and chilled. Port, marsala, sherry, vermouth, wine and sake all typically best consumed within a short time after opening, although the specific chemistry may vary. Some folks consider a sake that's been open, unrefrigerated, for more than a few weeks undrinkable. I don't know if I'm that rigid, but it's a good benchmark. I've seen certain sakes do ok for a few months in the refrigerator. </RelAText>

        <RelAText>It will keep until it doesn't. Eventually it will spoil, but because sake is considerably above the magic number for alcohol concentration to be self preserving when sealed (&gt;12.3% alcohol by volume), so long as you don't let any alcohol tolerant microbes into the bottle, then it will be fine. Smell it first,'if it smells earthy, throw it out, if it smells vinegary, you can use it but it's not rally sake anymore, it's rice wine vinegar. If you want, and if it's say half full, water it down and add a touch of cider vinegar to it. Cider vinegar isn't pasteurized so it will have live acetobacters in it and you can make your own vinegar. You need to cut the sake to half strength though otherwise it's too strong for the acetobacter to grow. </RelAText>

        <RelAText>Commercial pizza places usually use plastic dough proofing trays. They interlock and provide a relatively air-tight seal when they stack on top of each other. If you're looking for something that fits in your refrigerator, you should look into Artisan DoughMate trays. They are are 1/2 of the size of standard restaurant sized trays and you can fit a couple in your home fridge (Just under 18&quot; x 14&quot;) They stack with a very good air-tight seal and you just need a lid for the top one. You should be able to fit about six dough balls to a tray. If your only talking 2-3 dough balls then one tray would work, with a lid. But you also can look at aluminum dough pans. Some of these are also stackable with lids, and you put one dough ball into each one. I've often seen people spray the pans with oil so that the dough releases easily, or spray the dough balls so that if they spread into each other while proofing that don't make one massive dough ball. </RelAText>

        <RelAText>Try coating the dough ball with a little olive oil or a non-stick spray.  I don't know if that's the reason why but it's what I always do when baking bread and I never have a crust form during the rise. </RelAText>

        <RelAText>If you insist on using a damp cloth, you have to make it wet again and again, so this is quite cumbersome especially with long proofing times. Much easier is plastic wrap, which doesn't prevent the dough from rising if you use it to cover a sufficiently large bowl. Tightly wrapping the dough itself obviously won't work. My prefered method for these very long raises is a large food-safe plastic container with a lid. It doesn't have to be super-airtight and as I usually do a round of &quot;stretch and fold&quot; or quick punchdown every 12-24 hours I never had a problem with dried or overflowing dough.  </RelAText>

        <RelCText>If the company that puts out the fryer specifically says that 2.5 liters is required... is there a reason you think less would be OK? At the very least, we will need to know the brand and model of the one you have. There certainly may be some fryers that work with smaller amounts of oil but we can't tell you if yours is one of them if you don't tell us which fryer you have :)</RelCText>

        <RelAText>If you need a larger basket to fry the amount of food you want to cook, you need more oil as well. If you don't always want to make that much food (or use that much oil) then you need a smaller vessel for deep-frying, such as a second fryer or a small wok or kadai.  If you put less oil in than the minimum it may not cover the food and/or the oil could overheat, depending on how the fryer manages its temperature settings. Overheating oil can be dangerous and will also burn your food while leaving it raw inside. All around, something to avoid.  You can save and reuse frying oil. There are some good tips at the sites below. Let it cool fully then filter out food particles (I use coffee filters and a funnel for this; it can be a slow drain, be patient) Refrigerate used oil to retard bacterial growth  Stop using it if it looks weird or smells funny! http://www.seriouseats.com/2013/09/ask-the-food-lab-how-many-times-can-i-reuse-fry-oil.html http://extension.psu.edu/food/preservation/faq/questions-and-answers-about-re-using-frying-oil http://www.epicurious.com/expert-advice/you-can-reuse-frying-oil-article </RelAText>

        <RelAText>I'd dare say a small amount of oil can work if there is ample,controlled resupply of heat - why would it make much difference if it is coming from the vessel wall or more oil. However, I found that deep friers are just not designed for that, relying on the oil fill as thermal mass a lot... even or especially the small &quot;fondue&quot; style ones*. TL;DR for the rest of post: Advice on deep frying without using a fryer. Use at your own risk. You are better off with a chip pan/wok/pot and a thermometer for the kind of job where you just want to oil-blanch an ingredient and/or want to minimise oil usage because you do not want to reuse it (eg you want to fry tofu in fresh oil because it tends to be a magnet for the worst flavors it can get from old oil, you want to deep fry something with a strongly spiced and/or unruly rub/breading/batter on it, you want to fry ingredients like carrots or red bell pepper that will discolor the oil, you want to heat the oil very high initially to account for a temperature drop). The largest plate on even a normal electric hob is around 2000W - same as a medium sized home deep fryer, and pots and pans are optimized to transfer these 2000W to what is in them.  If you are not confident with open deep frying, have someone who is work with you for a while - yes it is hazardous, but manageably so - never leave the setup unattended. especially if no food in oil, monitor thermometer closely. always have something made of metal (nothing else) in reach that can cover the pot. always assume something can boil over. keep clutter away from your work area. use really high-heat oil - peanut, refined safflower, soy, rice bran; not some unspecified compound oil with a 180°C warning. be especially careful with induction, can heat a pot with small amounts of liquid in them alarmingly quick. keep the lid off as long as you are heating. if working on gas, ask someone who has experience in doing so for additional advice (overboiling into the burner is an obvious danger!), i'm electric... *the small ones that are partially plastic in construction - never managed to set a grease fire, but I think I would be far more at a loss to control one with these things than in a pot... </RelAText>

        <RelAText>I've used two different home-kitchen deep fryers over the last 18 years or so; one of them was essentially a kettle with a hidden heating element, and the other has a removable heating element that sits under the frying basket. The early one I used, the type with the hidden heating element, really has no minimum other than the basic rule-of-thumb that want at least 3x-4x the volume of oil to food being cooked, so that the oil doesn't cool down too quickly. The basket was the other factor, but if I remember correctly, my basket got pretty close to the bottom of the pan, so that wasn't a major consideration. A more serious model that I now use, which has a feature for filtering/draining oil, a more convincing thermostat, and electronic timers, has some more serious constraints, notably a minimum oil content of about 2.5 liters, and a maximum of maybe a tad over three liters. The minimum is pretty simple to explain: If you use less than 2.5 liters, none of the food will have enough room to float above the basket. You probably won't even cover the heating element without at least a liter of oil in there. Not covering the heating element has some serious consequences, namely the risk of the element glowing and eventually over-heating (based on the thermostat probe placement), oil spatter, and the more practical one of not being able to use the basket. The maximum fill line is an approximation designed to reduce the risk of oil boil-over. Having dealt with a oil boil-over on a friteuse meant for stovetop use in my starving student days in Germany, I can tell you the consequences are unpleasant. I had scars to prove it. High water content in some foods leads to furious bubbling, and if those bubbles manage to carry oil over the side of the pan, bad things happen. </RelAText>

          <RelACText>That was my thought, too -- I've seen way too many fryers where the basket stays an inch or two above the bottom, so a good deal of the oil is more heat-sync than actually coming into contact w/ the food.</RelACText>

        <RelAText>The whole point of deep frying is to use large amounts of oil. You don't want to just coat the food. You really need to have the food swim in a mass of oil much larger than the mass of the food. Else the food will cool down the oil locally and you won't get the desired crust.  So no, as long as you are using a large basket (which holds a large amount of food), you can't do proper deep frying with a small amount of oil. A consumer style deep fryer is probably already on the low side of the correct oil/food ratio.  </RelAText>

A few weeks ago I decided to try substituting the same quantity of home-made  greek-style yogurt in place of the whipping cream. They did not tenderize at all and although being fully cooked, were ‘crunchy’ and not desireable. As an experiment yesterday, I did another batch with part of it done with the original recipe using whipping cream,,  the rest with yogurt. All packets were done on the same grill side-by side with exactly the same time  temp. The packets with whipping cream were done perfectly  again the ones with yogurt were tough. My internet searches have not found any answers as to why this happened. In addition to wanting to understand the science of this difference, can anyone suggest changes I can make to have this substitution work? </RelQBody>

        <RelCText>Without seeing the recipe (permissions issue - it is not a public doc) it is hard to know if something else is going on, but at a minimum, the water content in cream is significantly higher than in Greek-style (strained) yogurt. I suspect that a non-strained yogurt would probably have a similar result to your cream version. You can also &quot;reconstitute&quot; strained yogurt by mixing water or milk in to give it a thinner texture which would also probably work. I doubt it is a chemical reaction, but the recipe would help.</RelCText>

        <RelAText>The amount of grease the meat exudes is dependent upon the amount of fat in the beef. If your beef is lean (10% fat), you will not likely notice a difference in the greasiness in the final product by not straining. If your meat is fatty (ground beef in the US can contain up to 30% fat), then the final product will have noticeable grease. The fat contributes in a good way (IMO) to the flavor and mouth-feel of chili if the meat is in the 15% range.  </RelAText>

        <RelCText>Have to suspect something about your cooking practices contributes to any issues you are having with PTFE. I did finally replace my 20 year old frying pan with a new one a few years back (as much for the new, thicker aluminum part as for a new cooking surface.) I don't use the PTFE for high-heat applications it's unsuited to, and I use non-metallic utensils appropriate for not scratching up the surface.

        <RelCText>Possibly, I have changed a few things over time. When I brown meat for the slow cooker, I now use cast iron. I've warped a few aluminum non sticks doing this because I add water to the pan to get the browning out to add to the roast. Other than that it seems that most frying pans just wont stay flat and tend to shed their coatings withing 5 or 6 years.</RelCText>

        <RelAText>Use maple sugar.

        <RelAText>I find that the chemical and mechanical reactions between egg-white, egg-yolk and sugar is quite an delicate and complex one. I find that there is even a difference in using white refined cane sugar and white refined beet sugars when baking and the amount of effort of creaming eggs and sugar. Sugar substitutes that claim that they &quot;behave&quot; the same as sugar also don't seem to react in a manner that you'd expect. I would suggest that you try a range of sugars... The worse of them seems to be corn based sugars. The eggs just don't behave at all... </RelAText>

        <RelQSubject>Flavor in avocadoes gone forever?</RelQSubject>
        <RelQBody>I got some made-in-store supermarket guacamole yesterday and it was a new low in bland, watery, flavorless avocado meat. I have read that the reason modern avocadoes taste bland is because they use a variety called a &quot;Hass&quot; avocado that growers prefer because it is resistant to some kinds of blight and it does not spoil as readily as other varieties. Nevertheless, as someone who remembers as a boy getting avocadoes that tasted like, well, avocadoes and actually having good guacamole, it is really discouraging the world takeover of this tasteless drone avocado called the Hass. Also, it seems the Hass itself seems to be getting more bland and more watery year by year. Is there any way to get good avocado varieties of the old type that actually taste good, or have they gone the way of the Dodo? (I should mention that I grew up in San Diego, but now live in Massachusetts so this might be part of the problem; good avocadoes might only be available locally in Southern California.) Update By some further research I have found that apparently large numbers of avocadoes are being exported by Peru, and even though they are Hass avocadoes they are reputedly MUCH more bland than California avocadoes, but also much cheaper. So, this might be the problem, I am getting Peruvian avocadoes. </RelQBody>

        <RelAText>You're exactly right in figuring out that part of the problem is having grown up with some of the world's best avocadoes, and then moving up North where decent avocadoes are scarce!  :)  Tasty avocadoes aren't all going the way of the dodo just yet, but you might have to move to Texas or Florida, or check some Mexican markets in your area, to get better avocadoes.  My husband lived in S Calif. as a child. He is an avocado connoisseur like you, as a result. Some of the best S Cali avocadoes are 'Fuerte' variety, which is more flavorful and creamier than Hass. We live in Texas and we get some very good, tasty Mexican avocadoes here- which by the way, are Hass.  But every single avocado I've brought home to hubby, whether from Mexico, Chile, Florida, Arizona, the Caribbean, Hawaii, Guatemala or Peru, ends up being compared unfavorably to those great S Calif. avocados he remembers. We visited a relative in the S Calif. area about 4.5 years ago and hubby had a delicious, fresh S Cali 'Fuerte' variety avocado during that trip--an avocado which he still recalls most fondly.  Personally I tried that same S Cali 'Fuerte' avocado too on that trip and while it was a bit tastier than the Hass avocadoes we currently get in Texas, I didn't find the flavor all THAT much better!  But hubby did prefer it a lot; he likes what he was raised on. Also his palate is more sensitive to bitterness than mine and 'Fuerte' is less bitter than Hass. In recent years, Calif. drought has made the delicious Cali avocadoes, especially the 'Fuerte', nearly impossible to get.  By the way- I lived in Illinois for a while. That state has the same avocado problem as Massachusetts: too far away from where good avocadoes and other tropical fruits are grown, to get avocadoes with decent quality. Whatever does survive the shipping journey that far North is usually picked much too green. Around the holidays such as Christmas and 16 de Septiembre and 5 de Mayo etc., there was ONE Mexican food store in Chicago that got some fresh, air-flown ripe Mexican avocadoes for sale just for these special days..at $5 each!   Mom who was raised in Texas was desperate for a good avocado because they are almost nonexistent in Chicago, so she bought 2 of those $5 avocados for Christmas dinner and said it was worth it. I had a small taste in my salad, it was great but geez $5 a piece LOL! I'm real glad we left Chicago and moved to Texas soon after that! I wouldn't count on S. California's avocado crop doing well anytime in the near future, as that area is likely to only have worse and worse water shortages and drought problems as time goes forward.  So perhaps, sadly, the 'Fuerte' avocadoes and the other delicious S Cali avocadoes you were raised on are going the way of the dodo. I hope not because they are very good avocadoes and it's always nice to be able to get USA grown tropical fruits. But unless some amazing advances in water and climate management are made to save the Cali avocado farms from extinction, your delicious S Cali grown avocadoes may become nothing more than a fond memory. </RelAText>

        <RelAText>If you have room to place the Wellingtons on the same shelf, you simply cook them in the same way as you would a single one. Conventional ovens do not work like microwaves - the amount of stuff in the oven makes no difference, providing air flow is maintained and you don't have something large right up at the top or bottom blocking an element. Fan ovens are especially useful as they actively circulate the heat around the oven cavity, so you can cook things on two different levels with fairly good consistency. </RelAText>

        <RelAText>I recon it has formed like a cake after cooling. The best option you have is to take a big chunk of it in a microwaveable container (making sure that you are not breaking the rice grains) and sprinkling with some water. Then cover with a cling film and microwave for 3-4 minutes from cold. Your rice grains will separate because of the extra moisture from the sprinkled water and the Pulao will become slightly moist.   But yes, Pulao is a dry dish and needs to be eaten with a side like Raita or Salan. </RelAText>

        <RelAText>Pulao is usually a &quot;dry&quot; dish without any gravy/sauce left in it when it finishes cooking. If the rice seems to be fully cooked and the individual grains do not seem to be under cooked or slightly crunchy then I think it is probably correct.  Many people serve raita (I like a simple yoghurt-onion-tomato mix with some chili powder and salt) and green coriander chutney along with pulao or biryani which helps to make the overall experience less dry. I usually cook the marinade as well to make a gravy/salan to serve on the side when I make chicken biryani. </RelAText>

        <RelAText>Unless contaminated by, say, drinking straight out of the bottle, it will likely be safe to consume, but it will probably have deteriorated in quality. Sake which is no longer appealing to drink may be suitable for use in cooking; if you're not accustomed to cooking with sake, consider something simple, like potatoes simmered with a modest amount of water, sake, salt  pepper, soy sauce and butter. Low-alcohol beverages, whether fermented or slightly fortified, tend to deteriorate in quality over time, although they will become stale less slowly if their containers are sealed airtight and chilled. Port, marsala, sherry, vermouth, wine and sake all typically best consumed within a short time after opening, although the specific chemistry may vary. Some folks consider a sake that's been open, unrefrigerated, for more than a few weeks undrinkable. I don't know if I'm that rigid, but it's a good benchmark. I've seen certain sakes do ok for a few months in the refrigerator. </RelAText>

        <RelAText>It will keep until it doesn't. Eventually it will spoil, but because sake is considerably above the magic number for alcohol concentration to be self preserving when sealed (&gt;12.3% alcohol by volume), so long as you don't let any alcohol tolerant microbes into the bottle, then it will be fine. Smell it first,'if it smells earthy, throw it out, if it smells vinegary, you can use it but it's not rally sake anymore, it's rice wine vinegar. If you want, and if it's say half full, water it down and add a touch of cider vinegar to it. Cider vinegar isn't pasteurized so it will have live acetobacters in it and you can make your own vinegar. You need to cut the sake to half strength though otherwise it's too strong for the acetobacter to grow. </RelAText>

        <RelAText>Commercial pizza places usually use plastic dough proofing trays. They interlock and provide a relatively air-tight seal when they stack on top of each other. If you're looking for something that fits in your refrigerator, you should look into Artisan DoughMate trays. They are are 1/2 of the size of standard restaurant sized trays and you can fit a couple in your home fridge (Just under 18&quot; x 14&quot;) They stack with a very good air-tight seal and you just need a lid for the top one. You should be able to fit about six dough balls to a tray. If your only talking 2-3 dough balls then one tray would work, with a lid. But you also can look at aluminum dough pans. Some of these are also stackable with lids, and you put one dough ball into each one. I've often seen people spray the pans with oil so that the dough releases easily, or spray the dough balls so that if they spread into each other while proofing that don't make one massive dough ball. </RelAText>

        <RelAText>Try coating the dough ball with a little olive oil or a non-stick spray.  I don't know if that's the reason why but it's what I always do when baking bread and I never have a crust form during the rise. </RelAText>

        <RelAText>If you insist on using a damp cloth, you have to make it wet again and again, so this is quite cumbersome especially with long proofing times. Much easier is plastic wrap, which doesn't prevent the dough from rising if you use it to cover a sufficiently large bowl. Tightly wrapping the dough itself obviously won't work. My prefered method for these very long raises is a large food-safe plastic container with a lid. It doesn't have to be super-airtight and as I usually do a round of &quot;stretch and fold&quot; or quick punchdown every 12-24 hours I never had a problem with dried or overflowing dough.  </RelAText>

        <RelQSubject>Minimum amount of oil that should be used in deep fryer</RelQSubject>
        <RelQBody>I have bought a 3 liter deep fryer. There was a 1.5 liter one available too but I wanted a larger basket. This 3 liter deep fryer requires 2.5 liters oil minimum. I had no idea about this. This quantity seems too much.  Can I use less? Has anyone any idea what would happen if I use less than the recommended? If I cannot use less than the minimum what do I have to do to make it last longer? </RelQBody>

        <RelCText>If the company that puts out the fryer specifically says that 2.5 liters is required... is there a reason you think less would be OK? At the very least, we will need to know the brand and model of the one you have. There certainly may be some fryers that work with smaller amounts of oil but we can't tell you if yours is one of them if you don't tell us which fryer you have :)</RelCText>

        <RelAText>If you need a larger basket to fry the amount of food you want to cook, you need more oil as well. If you don't always want to make that much food (or use that much oil) then you need a smaller vessel for deep-frying, such as a second fryer or a small wok or kadai.  If you put less oil in than the minimum it may not cover the food and/or the oil could overheat, depending on how the fryer manages its temperature settings. Overheating oil can be dangerous and will also burn your food while leaving it raw inside. All around, something to avoid.  You can save and reuse frying oil. There are some good tips at the sites below. Let it cool fully then filter out food particles (I use coffee filters and a funnel for this; it can be a slow drain, be patient) Refrigerate used oil to retard bacterial growth  Stop using it if it looks weird or smells funny! http://www.seriouseats.com/2013/09/ask-the-food-lab-how-many-times-can-i-reuse-fry-oil.html http://extension.psu.edu/food/preservation/faq/questions-and-answers-about-re-using-frying-oil http://www.epicurious.com/expert-advice/you-can-reuse-frying-oil-article </RelAText>

        <RelAText>I'd dare say a small amount of oil can work if there is ample,controlled resupply of heat - why would it make much difference if it is coming from the vessel wall or more oil. However, I found that deep friers are just not designed for that, relying on the oil fill as thermal mass a lot... even or especially the small &quot;fondue&quot; style ones*. TL;DR for the rest of post: Advice on deep frying without using a fryer. Use at your own risk. You are better off with a chip pan/wok/pot and a thermometer for the kind of job where you just want to oil-blanch an ingredient and/or want to minimise oil usage because you do not want to reuse it (eg you want to fry tofu in fresh oil because it tends to be a magnet for the worst flavors it can get from old oil, you want to deep fry something with a strongly spiced and/or unruly rub/breading/batter on it, you want to fry ingredients like carrots or red bell pepper that will discolor the oil, you want to heat the oil very high initially to account for a temperature drop). The largest plate on even a normal electric hob is around 2000W - same as a medium sized home deep fryer, and pots and pans are optimized to transfer these 2000W to what is in them.  If you are not confident with open deep frying, have someone who is work with you for a while - yes it is hazardous, but manageably so - never leave the setup unattended. especially if no food in oil, monitor thermometer closely. always have something made of metal (nothing else) in reach that can cover the pot. always assume something can boil over. keep clutter away from your work area. use really high-heat oil - peanut, refined safflower, soy, rice bran; not some unspecified compound oil with a 180°C warning. be especially careful with induction, can heat a pot with small amounts of liquid in them alarmingly quick. keep the lid off as long as you are heating. if working on gas, ask someone who has experience in doing so for additional advice (overboiling into the burner is an obvious danger!), i'm electric... *the small ones that are partially plastic in construction - never managed to set a grease fire, but I think I would be far more at a loss to control one with these things than in a pot... </RelAText>

        <RelAText>I've used two different home-kitchen deep fryers over the last 18 years or so; one of them was essentially a kettle with a hidden heating element, and the other has a removable heating element that sits under the frying basket. The early one I used, the type with the hidden heating element, really has no minimum other than the basic rule-of-thumb that want at least 3x-4x the volume of oil to food being cooked, so that the oil doesn't cool down too quickly. The basket was the other factor, but if I remember correctly, my basket got pretty close to the bottom of the pan, so that wasn't a major consideration. A more serious model that I now use, which has a feature for filtering/draining oil, a more convincing thermostat, and electronic timers, has some more serious constraints, notably a minimum oil content of about 2.5 liters, and a maximum of maybe a tad over three liters. The minimum is pretty simple to explain: If you use less than 2.5 liters, none of the food will have enough room to float above the basket. You probably won't even cover the heating element without at least a liter of oil in there. Not covering the heating element has some serious consequences, namely the risk of the element glowing and eventually over-heating (based on the thermostat probe placement), oil spatter, and the more practical one of not being able to use the basket. The maximum fill line is an approximation designed to reduce the risk of oil boil-over. Having dealt with a oil boil-over on a friteuse meant for stovetop use in my starving student days in Germany, I can tell you the consequences are unpleasant. I had scars to prove it. High water content in some foods leads to furious bubbling, and if those bubbles manage to carry oil over the side of the pan, bad things happen. </RelAText>

          <RelACText>That was my thought, too -- I've seen way too many fryers where the basket stays an inch or two above the bottom, so a good deal of the oil is more heat-sync than actually coming into contact w/ the food.</RelACText>

        <RelAText>The whole point of deep frying is to use large amounts of oil. You don't want to just coat the food. You really need to have the food swim in a mass of oil much larger than the mass of the food. Else the food will cool down the oil locally and you won't get the desired crust.  So no, as long as you are using a large basket (which holds a large amount of food), you can't do proper deep frying with a small amount of oil. A consumer style deep fryer is probably already on the low side of the correct oil/food ratio.  </RelAText>

        <RelQBody>I have a favorite tried  true recipe that I simply call ‘foil potatoes’.  recipe link: http://www.evernote.com/shard/s1/sh/048c56cc-1481-48b2-89e6-88e897da651a/b0c036a6448b07e0a486f77acf2111cb This has been made multiple times with consistently good results. A few weeks ago I decided to try substituting the same quantity of home-made  greek-style yogurt in place of the whipping cream. They did not tenderize at all and although being fully cooked, were ‘crunchy’ and not desireable. As an experiment yesterday, I did another batch with part of it done with the original recipe using whipping cream,,  the rest with yogurt. All packets were done on the same grill side-by side with exactly the same time  temp. The packets with whipping cream were done perfectly  again the ones with yogurt were tough. My internet searches have not found any answers as to why this happened. In addition to wanting to understand the science of this difference, can anyone suggest changes I can make to have this substitution work? </RelQBody>

        <RelCText>Without seeing the recipe (permissions issue - it is not a public doc) it is hard to know if something else is going on, but at a minimum, the water content in cream is significantly higher than in Greek-style (strained) yogurt. I suspect that a non-strained yogurt would probably have a similar result to your cream version. You can also &quot;reconstitute&quot; strained yogurt by mixing water or milk in to give it a thinner texture which would also probably work. I doubt it is a chemical reaction, but the recipe would help.</RelCText>

        <RelAText>The amount of grease the meat exudes is dependent upon the amount of fat in the beef. If your beef is lean (10% fat), you will not likely notice a difference in the greasiness in the final product by not straining. If your meat is fatty (ground beef in the US can contain up to 30% fat), then the final product will have noticeable grease. The fat contributes in a good way (IMO) to the flavor and mouth-feel of chili if the meat is in the 15% range.  </RelAText>

        <RelCText>Have to suspect something about your cooking practices contributes to any issues you are having with PTFE. I did finally replace my 20 year old frying pan with a new one a few years back (as much for the new, thicker aluminum part as for a new cooking surface.) I don't use the PTFE for high-heat applications it's unsuited to, and I use non-metallic utensils appropriate for not scratching up the surface. OTOH, the iron skillet I went off to college with is still going strong, but I use them for different things...</RelCText>

        <RelCText>Possibly, I have changed a few things over time. When I brown meat for the slow cooker, I now use cast iron. I've warped a few aluminum non sticks doing this because I add water to the pan to get the browning out to add to the roast. Other than that it seems that most frying pans just wont stay flat and tend to shed their coatings withing 5 or 6 years.</RelCText>

        <RelAText>Use maple sugar.  Things will taste better*, but cost more. *unless, of course, you are a person who does not like real maple (of whom there are a surprising number, though I cannot claim to understand that.) For ice cream/sorbet/gelato/frozen desserts, most &quot;sugar substitutes&quot; (low calorie sweeteners, etc) don't really work, as sugar plays an important structural role in how ice cream turns out. Being sugar, maple sugar (or other &quot;unrefined/less refined&quot; sugars) work fine. </RelAText>

        <RelAText>I find that the chemical and mechanical reactions between egg-white, egg-yolk and sugar is quite an delicate and complex one. I find that there is even a difference in using white refined cane sugar and white refined beet sugars when baking and the amount of effort of creaming eggs and sugar. Sugar substitutes that claim that they &quot;behave&quot; the same as sugar also don't seem to react in a manner that you'd expect. I would suggest that you try a range of sugars...

        <RelQSubject>Flavor in avocadoes gone forever?</RelQSubject>
        <RelQBody>I got some made-in-store supermarket guacamole yesterday and it was a new low in bland, watery, flavorless avocado meat. I have read that the reason modern avocadoes taste bland is because they use a variety called a &quot;Hass&quot; avocado that growers prefer because it is resistant to some kinds of blight and it does not spoil as readily as other varieties. Nevertheless, as someone who remembers as a boy getting avocadoes that tasted like, well, avocadoes and actually having good guacamole, it is really discouraging the world takeover of this tasteless drone avocado called the Hass. Also, it seems the Hass itself seems to be getting more bland and more watery year by year. Is there any way to get good avocado varieties of the old type that actually taste good, or have they gone the way of the Dodo? (I should mention that I grew up in San Diego, but now live in Massachusetts so this might be part of the problem; good avocadoes might only be available locally in Southern California.) Update By some further research I have found that apparently large numbers of avocadoes are being exported by Peru, and even though they are Hass avocadoes they are reputedly MUCH more bland than California avocadoes, but also much cheaper. So, this might be the problem, I am getting Peruvian avocadoes. </RelQBody>

        <RelCText>Good tropical fruit in Massachusetts is a rarity on all fronts. Picked underripe and shipped long distances does not ever compare well with picked at/near ripe from the farm up the road. Sometimes we see halfway decent Mexican or Florida avocados.

        <RelAText>You're exactly right in figuring out that part of the problem is having grown up with some of the world's best avocadoes, and then moving up North where decent avocadoes are scarce!  :)  Tasty avocadoes aren't all going the way of the dodo just yet, but you might have to move to Texas or Florida, or check some Mexican markets in your area, to get better avocadoes.  My husband lived in S Calif. as a child. He is an avocado connoisseur like you, as a result. Some of the best S Cali avocadoes are 'Fuerte' variety, which is more flavorful and creamier than Hass. We live in Texas and we get some very good, tasty Mexican avocadoes here- which by the way, are Hass.  But every single avocado I've brought home to hubby, whether from Mexico, Chile, Florida, Arizona, the Caribbean, Hawaii, Guatemala or Peru, ends up being compared unfavorably to those great S Calif. avocados he remembers. We visited a relative in the S Calif. area about 4.5 years ago and hubby had a delicious, fresh S Cali 'Fuerte' variety avocado during that trip--an avocado which he still recalls most fondly.  Personally I tried that same S Cali 'Fuerte' avocado too on that trip and while it was a bit tastier than the Hass avocadoes we currently get in Texas, I didn't find the flavor all THAT much better!  But hubby did prefer it a lot; he likes what he was raised on. Also his palate is more sensitive to bitterness than mine and 'Fuerte' is less bitter than Hass. In recent years, Calif. drought has made the delicious Cali avocadoes, especially the 'Fuerte', nearly impossible to get.  By the way- I lived in Illinois for a while. That state has the same avocado problem as Massachusetts: too far away from where good avocadoes and other tropical fruits are grown, to get avocadoes with decent quality. Whatever does survive the shipping journey that far North is usually picked much too green. Around the holidays such as Christmas and 16 de Septiembre and 5 de Mayo etc., there was ONE Mexican food store in Chicago that got some fresh, air-flown ripe Mexican avocadoes for sale just for these special days..at $5 each!   Mom who was raised in Texas was desperate for a good avocado because they are almost nonexistent in Chicago, so she bought 2 of those $5 avocados for Christmas dinner and said it was worth it. I had a small taste in my salad, it was great but geez $5 a piece LOL! I'm real glad we left Chicago and moved to Texas soon after that! I wouldn't count on S. California's avocado crop doing well anytime in the near future, as that area is likely to only have worse and worse water shortages and drought problems as time goes forward.  So perhaps, sadly, the 'Fuerte' avocadoes and the other delicious S Cali avocadoes you were raised on are going the way of the dodo. I hope not because they are very good avocadoes and it's always nice to be able to get USA grown tropical fruits. But unless some amazing advances in water and climate management are made to save the Cali avocado farms from extinction, your delicious S Cali grown avocadoes may become nothing more than a fond memory. </RelAText>

        <RelAText>If you have room to place the Wellingtons on the same shelf, you simply cook them in the same way as you would a single one. Conventional ovens do not work like microwaves - the amount of stuff in the oven makes no difference, providing air flow is maintained and you don't have something large right up at the top or bottom blocking an element. Fan ovens are especially useful as they actively circulate the heat around the oven cavity, so you can cook things on two different levels with fairly good consistency. </RelAText>

        <RelAText>I recon it has formed like a cake after cooling. The best option you have is to take a big chunk of it in a microwaveable container (making sure that you are not breaking the rice grains) and sprinkling with some water. Then cover with a cling film and microwave for 3-4 minutes from cold. Your rice grains will separate because of the extra moisture from the sprinkled water and the Pulao will become slightly moist.   But yes, Pulao is a dry dish and needs to be eaten with a side like Raita or Salan. </RelAText>

        <RelAText>Pulao is usually a &quot;dry&quot; dish without any gravy/sauce left in it when it finishes cooking. If the rice seems to be fully cooked and the individual grains do not seem to be under cooked or slightly crunchy then I think it is probably correct.  Many people serve raita (I like a simple yoghurt-onion-tomato mix with some chili powder and salt) and green coriander chutney along with pulao or biryani which helps to make the overall experience less dry. I usually cook the marinade as well to make a gravy/salan to serve on the side when I make chicken biryani. </RelAText>

        <RelAText>Unless contaminated by, say, drinking straight out of the bottle, it will likely be safe to consume, but it will probably have deteriorated in quality. Sake which is no longer appealing to drink may be suitable for use in cooking; if you're not accustomed to cooking with sake, consider something simple, like potatoes simmered with a modest amount of water, sake, salt  pepper, soy sauce and butter. Low-alcohol beverages, whether fermented or slightly fortified, tend to deteriorate in quality over time, although they will become stale less slowly if their containers are sealed airtight and chilled. Port, marsala, sherry, vermouth, wine and sake all typically best consumed within a short time after opening, although the specific chemistry may vary. Some folks consider a sake that's been open, unrefrigerated, for more than a few weeks undrinkable. I don't know if I'm that rigid, but it's a good benchmark. I've seen certain sakes do ok for a few months in the refrigerator. </RelAText>

        <RelAText>It will keep until it doesn't. Eventually it will spoil, but because sake is considerably above the magic number for alcohol concentration to be self preserving when sealed (&gt;12.3% alcohol by volume), so long as you don't let any alcohol tolerant microbes into the bottle, then it will be fine. Smell it first,'if it smells earthy, throw it out, if it smells vinegary, you can use it but it's not rally sake anymore, it's rice wine vinegar. If you want, and if it's say half full, water it down and add a touch of cider vinegar to it. Cider vinegar isn't pasteurized so it will have live acetobacters in it and you can make your own vinegar. You need to cut the sake to half strength though otherwise it's too strong for the acetobacter to grow. </RelAText>

        <RelAText>Commercial pizza places usually use plastic dough proofing trays. They interlock and provide a relatively air-tight seal when they stack on top of each other. If you're looking for something that fits in your refrigerator, you should look into Artisan DoughMate trays. They are are 1/2 of the size of standard restaurant sized trays and you can fit a couple in your home fridge (Just under 18&quot; x 14&quot;) They stack with a very good air-tight seal and you just need a lid for the top one. You should be able to fit about six dough balls to a tray. If your only talking 2-3 dough balls then one tray would work, with a lid. But you also can look at aluminum dough pans. Some of these are also stackable with lids, and you put one dough ball into each one. I've often seen people spray the pans with oil so that the dough releases easily, or spray the dough balls so that if they spread into each other while proofing that don't make one massive dough ball. </RelAText>

        <RelAText>Try coating the dough ball with a little olive oil or a non-stick spray.  I don't know if that's the reason why but it's what I always do when baking bread and I never have a crust form during the rise. </RelAText>

        <RelAText>If you insist on using a damp cloth, you have to make it wet again and again, so this is quite cumbersome especially with long proofing times. Much easier is plastic wrap, which doesn't prevent the dough from rising if you use it to cover a sufficiently large bowl. Tightly wrapping the dough itself obviously won't work. My prefered method for these very long raises is a large food-safe plastic container with a lid.

        <RelCText>If the company that puts out the fryer specifically says that 2.5 liters is required... is there a reason you think less would be OK? At the very least, we will need to know the brand and model of the one you have.

        <RelAText>If you need a larger basket to fry the amount of food you want to cook, you need more oil as well. If you don't always want to make that much food (or use that much oil) then you need a smaller vessel for deep-frying, such as a second fryer or a small wok or kadai.  If you put less oil in than the minimum it may not cover the food and/or the oil could overheat, depending on how the fryer manages its temperature settings. Overheating oil can be dangerous and will also burn your food while leaving it raw inside. All around, something to avoid.  You can save and reuse frying oil. There are some good tips at the sites below. Let it cool fully then filter out food particles (I use coffee filters and a funnel for this; it can be a slow drain, be patient) Refrigerate used oil to retard bacterial growth  Stop using it if it looks weird or smells funny! http://www.seriouseats.com/2013/09/ask-the-food-lab-how-many-times-can-i-reuse-fry-oil.html http://extension.psu.edu/food/preservation/faq/questions-and-answers-about-re-using-frying-oil http://www.epicurious.com/expert-advice/you-can-reuse-frying-oil-article </RelAText>

        <RelAText>I'd dare say a small amount of oil can work if there is ample,controlled resupply of heat - why would it make much difference if it is coming from the vessel wall or more oil. However, I found that deep friers are just not designed for that, relying on the oil fill as thermal mass a lot... even or especially the small &quot;fondue&quot; style ones*. TL;DR for the rest of post: Advice on deep frying without using a fryer. Use at your own risk. You are better off with a chip pan/wok/pot and a thermometer for the kind of job where you just want to oil-blanch an ingredient and/or want to minimise oil usage because you do not want to reuse it (eg you want to fry tofu in fresh oil because it tends to be a magnet for the worst flavors it can get from old oil, you want to deep fry something with a strongly spiced and/or unruly rub/breading/batter on it, you want to fry ingredients like carrots or red bell pepper that will discolor the oil, you want to heat the oil very high initially to account for a temperature drop). The largest plate on even a normal electric hob is around 2000W - same as a medium sized home deep fryer, and pots and pans are optimized to transfer these 2000W to what is in them.  If you are not confident with open deep frying, have someone who is work with you for a while - yes it is hazardous, but manageably so - never leave the setup unattended. especially if no food in oil, monitor thermometer closely. always have something made of metal (nothing else) in reach that can cover the pot. always assume something can boil over. keep clutter away from your work area. use really high-heat oil - peanut, refined safflower, soy, rice bran; not some unspecified compound oil with a 180°C warning. be especially careful with induction, can heat a pot with small amounts of liquid in them alarmingly quick. keep the lid off as long as you are heating. if working on gas, ask someone who has experience in doing so for additional advice (overboiling into the burner is an obvious danger!), i'm electric... *the small ones that are partially plastic in construction - never managed to set a grease fire, but I think I would be far more at a loss to control one with these things than in a pot... </RelAText>

        <RelAText>I've used two different home-kitchen deep fryers over the last 18 years or so; one of them was essentially a kettle with a hidden heating element, and the other has a removable heating element that sits under the frying basket. The early one I used, the type with the hidden heating element, really has no minimum other than the basic rule-of-thumb that want at least 3x-4x the volume of oil to food being cooked, so that the oil doesn't cool down too quickly. The basket was the other factor, but if I remember correctly, my basket got pretty close to the bottom of the pan, so that wasn't a major consideration. A more serious model that I now use, which has a feature for filtering/draining oil, a more convincing thermostat, and electronic timers, has some more serious constraints, notably a minimum oil content of about 2.5 liters, and a maximum of maybe a tad over three liters. The minimum is pretty simple to explain: If you use less than 2.5 liters, none of the food will have enough room to float above the basket. You probably won't even cover the heating element without at least a liter of oil in there. Not covering the heating element has some serious consequences, namely the risk of the element glowing and eventually over-heating (based on the thermostat probe placement), oil spatter, and the more practical one of not being able to use the basket. The maximum fill line is an approximation designed to reduce the risk of oil boil-over. Having dealt with a oil boil-over on a friteuse meant for stovetop use in my starving student days in Germany, I can tell you the consequences are unpleasant. I had scars to prove it. High water content in some foods leads to furious bubbling, and if those bubbles manage to carry oil over the side of the pan, bad things happen. </RelAText>

          <RelACText>That was my thought, too -- I've seen way too many fryers where the basket stays an inch or two above the bottom, so a good deal of the oil is more heat-sync than actually coming into contact w/ the food.</RelACText>

        <RelAText>The whole point of deep frying is to use large amounts of oil. You don't want to just coat the food. You really need to have the food swim in a mass of oil much larger than the mass of the food. Else the food will cool down the oil locally and you won't get the desired crust.  So no, as long as you are using a large basket (which holds a large amount of food), you can't do proper deep frying with a small amount of oil. A consumer style deep fryer is probably already on the low side of the correct oil/food ratio.  </RelAText>

A few weeks ago I decided to try substituting the same quantity of home-made  greek-style yogurt in place of the whipping cream. They did not tenderize at all and although being fully cooked, were ‘crunchy’ and not desireable. As an experiment yesterday, I did another batch with part of it done with the original recipe using whipping cream,,  the rest with yogurt. All packets were done on the same grill side-by side with exactly the same time  temp. The packets with whipping cream were done perfectly  again the ones with yogurt were tough. My internet searches have not found any answers as to why this happened. In addition to wanting to understand the science of this difference, can anyone suggest changes I can make to have this substitution work? </RelQBody>

        <RelCText>Without seeing the recipe (permissions issue - it is not a public doc) it is hard to know if something else is going on, but at a minimum, the water content in cream is significantly higher than in Greek-style (strained) yogurt. I suspect that a non-strained yogurt would probably have a similar result to your cream version. You can also &quot;reconstitute&quot; strained yogurt by mixing water or milk in to give it a thinner texture which would also probably work. I doubt it is a chemical reaction, but the recipe would help.</RelCText>

        <RelAText>The amount of grease the meat exudes is dependent upon the amount of fat in the beef. If your beef is lean (10% fat), you will not likely notice a difference in the greasiness in the final product by not straining. If your meat is fatty (ground beef in the US can contain up to 30% fat), then the final product will have noticeable grease. The fat contributes in a good way (IMO) to the flavor and mouth-feel of chili if the meat is in the 15% range.  </RelAText>

        <RelCText>Have to suspect something about your cooking practices contributes to any issues you are having with PTFE. I did finally replace my 20 year old frying pan with a new one a few years back (as much for the new, thicker aluminum part as for a new cooking surface.) I don't use the PTFE for high-heat applications it's unsuited to, and I use non-metallic utensils appropriate for not scratching up the surface. OTOH, the iron skillet I went off to college with is still going strong, but I use them for different things...</RelCText>

        <RelCText>Possibly, I have changed a few things over time. When I brown meat for the slow cooker, I now use cast iron. I've warped a few aluminum non sticks doing this because I add water to the pan to get the browning out to add to the roast. Other than that it seems that most frying pans just wont stay flat and tend to shed their coatings withing 5 or 6 years.</RelCText>

For ice cream/sorbet/gelato/frozen desserts, most &quot;sugar substitutes&quot; (low calorie sweeteners, etc) don't really work, as sugar plays an important structural role in how ice cream turns out.

        <RelAText>I find that the chemical and mechanical reactions between egg-white, egg-yolk and sugar is quite an delicate and complex one. I find that there is even a difference in using white refined cane sugar and white refined beet sugars when baking and the amount of effort of creaming eggs and sugar. Sugar substitutes that claim that they &quot;behave&quot; the same as sugar also don't seem to react in a manner that you'd expect. I would suggest that you try a range of sugars... The worse of them seems to be corn based sugars. The eggs just don't behave at all... </RelAText>

        <RelQSubject>Flavor in avocadoes gone forever?</RelQSubject>
        <RelQBody>I got some made-in-store supermarket guacamole yesterday and it was a new low in bland, watery, flavorless avocado meat. I have read that the reason modern avocadoes taste bland is because they use a variety called a &quot;Hass&quot; avocado that growers prefer because it is resistant to some kinds of blight and it does not spoil as readily as other varieties. Nevertheless, as someone who remembers as a boy getting avocadoes that tasted like, well, avocadoes and actually having good guacamole, it is really discouraging the world takeover of this tasteless drone avocado called the Hass. Also, it seems the Hass itself seems to be getting more bland and more watery year by year. Is there any way to get good avocado varieties of the old type that actually taste good, or have they gone the way of the Dodo? (I should mention that I grew up in San Diego, but now live in Massachusetts so this might be part of the problem; good avocadoes might only be available locally in Southern California.) Update By some further research I have found that apparently large numbers of avocadoes are being exported by Peru, and even though they are Hass avocadoes they are reputedly MUCH more bland than California avocadoes, but also much cheaper. So, this might be the problem, I am getting Peruvian avocadoes. </RelQBody>

        <RelCText>CA is in the midst of a drought. Haven't seen a good avocado from there all year.

        <RelCText>Good tropical fruit in Massachusetts is a rarity on all fronts. Picked underripe and shipped long distances does not ever compare well with picked at/near ripe from the farm up the road. Sometimes we see halfway decent Mexican or Florida avocados.

        <RelAText>You're exactly right in figuring out that part of the problem is having grown up with some of the world's best avocadoes, and then moving up North where decent avocadoes are scarce!  :)  Tasty avocadoes aren't all going the way of the dodo just yet, but you might have to move to Texas or Florida, or check some Mexican markets in your area, to get better avocadoes.  My husband lived in S Calif. as a child. He is an avocado connoisseur like you, as a result. Some of the best S Cali avocadoes are 'Fuerte' variety, which is more flavorful and creamier than Hass. We live in Texas and we get some very good, tasty Mexican avocadoes here- which by the way, are Hass.  But every single avocado I've brought home to hubby, whether from Mexico, Chile, Florida, Arizona, the Caribbean, Hawaii, Guatemala or Peru, ends up being compared unfavorably to those great S Calif. avocados he remembers. We visited a relative in the S Calif. area about 4.5 years ago and hubby had a delicious, fresh S Cali 'Fuerte' variety avocado during that trip--an avocado which he still recalls most fondly.  Personally I tried that same S Cali 'Fuerte' avocado too on that trip and while it was a bit tastier than the Hass avocadoes we currently get in Texas, I didn't find the flavor all THAT much better!  But hubby did prefer it a lot; he likes what he was raised on. Also his palate is more sensitive to bitterness than mine and 'Fuerte' is less bitter than Hass. In recent years, Calif. drought has made the delicious Cali avocadoes, especially the 'Fuerte', nearly impossible to get.  By the way- I lived in Illinois for a while. That state has the same avocado problem as Massachusetts: too far away from where good avocadoes and other tropical fruits are grown, to get avocadoes with decent quality. Whatever does survive the shipping journey that far North is usually picked much too green. Around the holidays such as Christmas and 16 de Septiembre and 5 de Mayo etc., there was ONE Mexican food store in Chicago that got some fresh, air-flown ripe Mexican avocadoes for sale just for these special days..at $5 each!   Mom who was raised in Texas was desperate for a good avocado because they are almost nonexistent in Chicago, so she bought 2 of those $5 avocados for Christmas dinner and said it was worth it. I had a small taste in my salad, it was great but geez $5 a piece LOL! I'm real glad we left Chicago and moved to Texas soon after that! I wouldn't count on S. California's avocado crop doing well anytime in the near future, as that area is likely to only have worse and worse water shortages and drought problems as time goes forward.  So perhaps, sadly, the 'Fuerte' avocadoes and the other delicious S Cali avocadoes you were raised on are going the way of the dodo. I hope not because they are very good avocadoes and it's always nice to be able to get USA grown tropical fruits. But unless some amazing advances in water and climate management are made to save the Cali avocado farms from extinction, your delicious S Cali grown avocadoes may become nothing more than a fond memory. </RelAText>

        <RelAText>If you have room to place the Wellingtons on the same shelf, you simply cook them in the same way as you would a single one. Conventional ovens do not work like microwaves - the amount of stuff in the oven makes no difference, providing air flow is maintained and you don't have something large right up at the top or bottom blocking an element. Fan ovens are especially useful as they actively circulate the heat around the oven cavity, so you can cook things on two different levels with fairly good consistency. </RelAText>

        <RelAText>I recon it has formed like a cake after cooling. The best option you have is to take a big chunk of it in a microwaveable container (making sure that you are not breaking the rice grains) and sprinkling with some water. Then cover with a cling film and microwave for 3-4 minutes from cold. Your rice grains will separate because of the extra moisture from the sprinkled water and the Pulao will become slightly moist.   But yes, Pulao is a dry dish and needs to be eaten with a side like Raita or Salan. </RelAText>

        <RelAText>Pulao is usually a &quot;dry&quot; dish without any gravy/sauce left in it when it finishes cooking. If the rice seems to be fully cooked and the individual grains do not seem to be under cooked or slightly crunchy then I think it is probably correct.  Many people serve raita (I like a simple yoghurt-onion-tomato mix with some chili powder and salt) and green coriander chutney along with pulao or biryani which helps to make the overall experience less dry. I usually cook the marinade as well to make a gravy/salan to serve on the side when I make chicken biryani. </RelAText>

        <RelAText>Unless contaminated by, say, drinking straight out of the bottle, it will likely be safe to consume, but it will probably have deteriorated in quality. Sake which is no longer appealing to drink may be suitable for use in cooking; if you're not accustomed to cooking with sake, consider something simple, like potatoes simmered with a modest amount of water, sake, salt  pepper, soy sauce and butter. Low-alcohol beverages, whether fermented or slightly fortified, tend to deteriorate in quality over time, although they will become stale less slowly if their containers are sealed airtight and chilled. Port, marsala, sherry, vermouth, wine and sake all typically best consumed within a short time after opening, although the specific chemistry may vary. Some folks consider a sake that's been open, unrefrigerated, for more than a few weeks undrinkable. I don't know if I'm that rigid, but it's a good benchmark. I've seen certain sakes do ok for a few months in the refrigerator. </RelAText>

        <RelAText>It will keep until it doesn't. Eventually it will spoil, but because sake is considerably above the magic number for alcohol concentration to be self preserving when sealed (&gt;12.3% alcohol by volume), so long as you don't let any alcohol tolerant microbes into the bottle, then it will be fine. Smell it first,'if it smells earthy, throw it out, if it smells vinegary, you can use it but it's not rally sake anymore, it's rice wine vinegar. If you want, and if it's say half full, water it down and add a touch of cider vinegar to it. Cider vinegar isn't pasteurized so it will have live acetobacters in it and you can make your own vinegar. You need to cut the sake to half strength though otherwise it's too strong for the acetobacter to grow. </RelAText>

        <RelAText>Commercial pizza places usually use plastic dough proofing trays. They interlock and provide a relatively air-tight seal when they stack on top of each other. If you're looking for something that fits in your refrigerator, you should look into Artisan DoughMate trays. They are are 1/2 of the size of standard restaurant sized trays and you can fit a couple in your home fridge (Just under 18&quot; x 14&quot;) They stack with a very good air-tight seal and you just need a lid for the top one. You should be able to fit about six dough balls to a tray. If your only talking 2-3 dough balls then one tray would work, with a lid. But you also can look at aluminum dough pans. Some of these are also stackable with lids, and you put one dough ball into each one. I've often seen people spray the pans with oil so that the dough releases easily, or spray the dough balls so that if they spread into each other while proofing that don't make one massive dough ball. </RelAText>

        <RelAText>Try coating the dough ball with a little olive oil or a non-stick spray.  I don't know if that's the reason why but it's what I always do when baking bread and I never have a crust form during the rise. </RelAText>

        <RelAText>If you insist on using a damp cloth, you have to make it wet again and again, so this is quite cumbersome especially with long proofing times. Much easier is plastic wrap, which doesn't prevent the dough from rising if you use it to cover a sufficiently large bowl. Tightly wrapping the dough itself obviously won't work. My prefered method for these very long raises is a large food-safe plastic container with a lid. It doesn't have to be super-airtight and as I usually do a round of &quot;stretch and fold&quot; or quick punchdown every 12-24 hours I never had a problem with dried or overflowing dough.  </RelAText>

        <RelCText>If the company that puts out the fryer specifically says that 2.5 liters is required... is there a reason you think less would be OK? At the very least, we will need to know the brand and model of the one you have.

        <RelAText>If you need a larger basket to fry the amount of food you want to cook, you need more oil as well. If you don't always want to make that much food (or use that much oil) then you need a smaller vessel for deep-frying, such as a second fryer or a small wok or kadai.  If you put less oil in than the minimum it may not cover the food and/or the oil could overheat, depending on how the fryer manages its temperature settings. Overheating oil can be dangerous and will also burn your food while leaving it raw inside. All around, something to avoid.  You can save and reuse frying oil. There are some good tips at the sites below. Let it cool fully then filter out food particles (I use coffee filters and a funnel for this; it can be a slow drain, be patient) Refrigerate used oil to retard bacterial growth  Stop using it if it looks weird or smells funny! http://www.seriouseats.com/2013/09/ask-the-food-lab-how-many-times-can-i-reuse-fry-oil.html http://extension.psu.edu/food/preservation/faq/questions-and-answers-about-re-using-frying-oil http://www.epicurious.com/expert-advice/you-can-reuse-frying-oil-article </RelAText>

        <RelAText>I'd dare say a small amount of oil can work if there is ample,controlled resupply of heat - why would it make much difference if it is coming from the vessel wall or more oil. However, I found that deep friers are just not designed for that, relying on the oil fill as thermal mass a lot... even or especially the small &quot;fondue&quot; style ones*. TL;DR for the rest of post: Advice on deep frying without using a fryer. Use at your own risk. You are better off with a chip pan/wok/pot and a thermometer for the kind of job where you just want to oil-blanch an ingredient and/or want to minimise oil usage because you do not want to reuse it (eg you want to fry tofu in fresh oil because it tends to be a magnet for the worst flavors it can get from old oil, you want to deep fry something with a strongly spiced and/or unruly rub/breading/batter on it, you want to fry ingredients like carrots or red bell pepper that will discolor the oil, you want to heat the oil very high initially to account for a temperature drop). The largest plate on even a normal electric hob is around 2000W - same as a medium sized home deep fryer, and pots and pans are optimized to transfer these 2000W to what is in them.  If you are not confident with open deep frying, have someone who is work with you for a while - yes it is hazardous, but manageably so - never leave the setup unattended. especially if no food in oil, monitor thermometer closely. always have something made of metal (nothing else) in reach that can cover the pot. always assume something can boil over. keep clutter away from your work area. use really high-heat oil - peanut, refined safflower, soy, rice bran; not some unspecified compound oil with a 180°C warning. be especially careful with induction, can heat a pot with small amounts of liquid in them alarmingly quick. keep the lid off as long as you are heating. if working on gas, ask someone who has experience in doing so for additional advice (overboiling into the burner is an obvious danger!), i'm electric... *the small ones that are partially plastic in construction - never managed to set a grease fire, but I think I would be far more at a loss to control one with these things than in a pot... </RelAText>

        <RelAText>I've used two different home-kitchen deep fryers over the last 18 years or so; one of them was essentially a kettle with a hidden heating element, and the other has a removable heating element that sits under the frying basket. The early one I used, the type with the hidden heating element, really has no minimum other than the basic rule-of-thumb that want at least 3x-4x the volume of oil to food being cooked, so that the oil doesn't cool down too quickly. The basket was the other factor, but if I remember correctly, my basket got pretty close to the bottom of the pan, so that wasn't a major consideration. A more serious model that I now use, which has a feature for filtering/draining oil, a more convincing thermostat, and electronic timers, has some more serious constraints, notably a minimum oil content of about 2.5 liters, and a maximum of maybe a tad over three liters. The minimum is pretty simple to explain: If you use less than 2.5 liters, none of the food will have enough room to float above the basket. You probably won't even cover the heating element without at least a liter of oil in there. Not covering the heating element has some serious consequences, namely the risk of the element glowing and eventually over-heating (based on the thermostat probe placement), oil spatter, and the more practical one of not being able to use the basket. The maximum fill line is an approximation designed to reduce the risk of oil boil-over. Having dealt with a oil boil-over on a friteuse meant for stovetop use in my starving student days in Germany, I can tell you the consequences are unpleasant. I had scars to prove it. High water content in some foods leads to furious bubbling, and if those bubbles manage to carry oil over the side of the pan, bad things happen. </RelAText>

          <RelACText>That was my thought, too -- I've seen way too many fryers where the basket stays an inch or two above the bottom, so a good deal of the oil is more heat-sync than actually coming into contact w/ the food.</RelACText>

        <RelAText>The whole point of deep frying is to use large amounts of oil. You don't want to just coat the food. You really need to have the food swim in a mass of oil much larger than the mass of the food. Else the food will cool down the oil locally and you won't get the desired crust.  So no, as long as you are using a large basket (which holds a large amount of food), you can't do proper deep frying with a small amount of oil. A consumer style deep fryer is probably already on the low side of the correct oil/food ratio.  </RelAText>

A few weeks ago I decided to try substituting the same quantity of home-made  greek-style yogurt in place of the whipping cream. They did not tenderize at all and although being fully cooked, were ‘crunchy’ and not desireable. As an experiment yesterday, I did another batch with part of it done with the original recipe using whipping cream,,  the rest with yogurt. All packets were done on the same grill side-by side with exactly the same time  temp. The packets with whipping cream were done perfectly  again the ones with yogurt were tough. My internet searches have not found any answers as to why this happened. In addition to wanting to understand the science of this difference, can anyone suggest changes I can make to have this substitution work? </RelQBody>

        <RelCText>Without seeing the recipe (permissions issue - it is not a public doc) it is hard to know if something else is going on, but at a minimum, the water content in cream is significantly higher than in Greek-style (strained) yogurt. I suspect that a non-strained yogurt would probably have a similar result to your cream version. You can also &quot;reconstitute&quot; strained yogurt by mixing water or milk in to give it a thinner texture which would also probably work. I doubt it is a chemical reaction, but the recipe would help.</RelCText>

        <RelAText>The amount of grease the meat exudes is dependent upon the amount of fat in the beef. If your beef is lean (10% fat), you will not likely notice a difference in the greasiness in the final product by not straining. If your meat is fatty (ground beef in the US can contain up to 30% fat), then the final product will have noticeable grease. The fat contributes in a good way (IMO) to the flavor and mouth-feel of chili if the meat is in the 15% range.  </RelAText>

        <RelCText>Have to suspect something about your cooking practices contributes to any issues you are having with PTFE. I did finally replace my 20 year old frying pan with a new one a few years back (as much for the new, thicker aluminum part as for a new cooking surface.) I don't use the PTFE for high-heat applications it's unsuited to, and I use non-metallic utensils appropriate for not scratching up the surface. OTOH, the iron skillet I went off to college with is still going strong, but I use them for different things...</RelCText>

        <RelCText>Possibly, I have changed a few things over time. When I brown meat for the slow cooker, I now use cast iron. I've warped a few aluminum non sticks doing this because I add water to the pan to get the browning out to add to the roast.

For ice cream/sorbet/gelato/frozen desserts, most &quot;sugar substitutes&quot; (low calorie sweeteners, etc) don't really work, as sugar plays an important structural role in how ice cream turns out.

        <RelAText>I find that the chemical and mechanical reactions between egg-white, egg-yolk and sugar is quite an delicate and complex one. I find that there is even a difference in using white refined cane sugar and white refined beet sugars when baking and the amount of effort of creaming eggs and sugar. Sugar substitutes that claim that they &quot;behave&quot; the same as sugar also don't seem to react in a manner that you'd expect. I would suggest that you try a range of sugars... The worse of them seems to be corn based sugars. The eggs just don't behave at all... </RelAText>

        <RelQSubject>Flavor in avocadoes gone forever?</RelQSubject>
        <RelQBody>I got some made-in-store supermarket guacamole yesterday and it was a new low in bland, watery, flavorless avocado meat. I have read that the reason modern avocadoes taste bland is because they use a variety called a &quot;Hass&quot; avocado that growers prefer because it is resistant to some kinds of blight and it does not spoil as readily as other varieties. Nevertheless, as someone who remembers as a boy getting avocadoes that tasted like, well, avocadoes and actually having good guacamole, it is really discouraging the world takeover of this tasteless drone avocado called the Hass. Also, it seems the Hass itself seems to be getting more bland and more watery year by year. Is there any way to get good avocado varieties of the old type that actually taste good, or have they gone the way of the Dodo? (I should mention that I grew up in San Diego, but now live in Massachusetts so this might be part of the problem; good avocadoes might only be available locally in Southern California.) Update By some further research I have found that apparently large numbers of avocadoes are being exported by Peru, and even though they are Hass avocadoes they are reputedly MUCH more bland than California avocadoes, but also much cheaper. So, this might be the problem, I am getting Peruvian avocadoes. </RelQBody>

        <RelCText>CA is in the midst of a drought. Haven't seen a good avocado from there all year.

        <RelCText>Good tropical fruit in Massachusetts is a rarity on all fronts. Picked underripe and shipped long distances does not ever compare well with picked at/near ripe from the farm up the road. Sometimes we see halfway decent Mexican or Florida avocados.

        <RelAText>You're exactly right in figuring out that part of the problem is having grown up with some of the world's best avocadoes, and then moving up North where decent avocadoes are scarce!  :)  Tasty avocadoes aren't all going the way of the dodo just yet, but you might have to move to Texas or Florida, or check some Mexican markets in your area, to get better avocadoes.  My husband lived in S Calif. as a child. He is an avocado connoisseur like you, as a result. Some of the best S Cali avocadoes are 'Fuerte' variety, which is more flavorful and creamier than Hass. We live in Texas and we get some very good, tasty Mexican avocadoes here- which by the way, are Hass.  But every single avocado I've brought home to hubby, whether from Mexico, Chile, Florida, Arizona, the Caribbean, Hawaii, Guatemala or Peru, ends up being compared unfavorably to those great S Calif. avocados he remembers. We visited a relative in the S Calif. area about 4.5 years ago and hubby had a delicious, fresh S Cali 'Fuerte' variety avocado during that trip--an avocado which he still recalls most fondly.  Personally I tried that same S Cali 'Fuerte' avocado too on that trip and while it was a bit tastier than the Hass avocadoes we currently get in Texas, I didn't find the flavor all THAT much better!  But hubby did prefer it a lot; he likes what he was raised on. Also his palate is more sensitive to bitterness than mine and 'Fuerte' is less bitter than Hass. In recent years, Calif. drought has made the delicious Cali avocadoes, especially the 'Fuerte', nearly impossible to get.  By the way- I lived in Illinois for a while. That state has the same avocado problem as Massachusetts: too far away from where good avocadoes and other tropical fruits are grown, to get avocadoes with decent quality. Whatever does survive the shipping journey that far North is usually picked much too green. Around the holidays such as Christmas and 16 de Septiembre and 5 de Mayo etc., there was ONE Mexican food store in Chicago that got some fresh, air-flown ripe Mexican avocadoes for sale just for these special days..at $5 each!   Mom who was raised in Texas was desperate for a good avocado because they are almost nonexistent in Chicago, so she bought 2 of those $5 avocados for Christmas dinner and said it was worth it. I had a small taste in my salad, it was great but geez $5 a piece LOL! I'm real glad we left Chicago and moved to Texas soon after that! I wouldn't count on S. California's avocado crop doing well anytime in the near future, as that area is likely to only have worse and worse water shortages and drought problems as time goes forward.  So perhaps, sadly, the 'Fuerte' avocadoes and the other delicious S Cali avocadoes you were raised on are going the way of the dodo. I hope not because they are very good avocadoes and it's always nice to be able to get USA grown tropical fruits. But unless some amazing advances in water and climate management are made to save the Cali avocado farms from extinction, your delicious S Cali grown avocadoes may become nothing more than a fond memory. </RelAText>

        <RelAText>If you have room to place the Wellingtons on the same shelf, you simply cook them in the same way as you would a single one. Conventional ovens do not work like microwaves - the amount of stuff in the oven makes no difference, providing air flow is maintained and you don't have something large right up at the top or bottom blocking an element. Fan ovens are especially useful as they actively circulate the heat around the oven cavity, so you can cook things on two different levels with fairly good consistency. </RelAText>

        <RelAText>I recon it has formed like a cake after cooling. The best option you have is to take a big chunk of it in a microwaveable container (making sure that you are not breaking the rice grains) and sprinkling with some water. Then cover with a cling film and microwave for 3-4 minutes from cold. Your rice grains will separate because of the extra moisture from the sprinkled water and the Pulao will become slightly moist.   But yes, Pulao is a dry dish and needs to be eaten with a side like Raita or Salan. </RelAText>

        <RelAText>Pulao is usually a &quot;dry&quot; dish without any gravy/sauce left in it when it finishes cooking. If the rice seems to be fully cooked and the individual grains do not seem to be under cooked or slightly crunchy then I think it is probably correct.  Many people serve raita (I like a simple yoghurt-onion-tomato mix with some chili powder and salt) and green coriander chutney along with pulao or biryani which helps to make the overall experience less dry. I usually cook the marinade as well to make a gravy/salan to serve on the side when I make chicken biryani. </RelAText>

        <RelAText>Unless contaminated by, say, drinking straight out of the bottle, it will likely be safe to consume, but it will probably have deteriorated in quality. Sake which is no longer appealing to drink may be suitable for use in cooking; if you're not accustomed to cooking with sake, consider something simple, like potatoes simmered with a modest amount of water, sake, salt  pepper, soy sauce and butter. Low-alcohol beverages, whether fermented or slightly fortified, tend to deteriorate in quality over time, although they will become stale less slowly if their containers are sealed airtight and chilled. Port, marsala, sherry, vermouth, wine and sake all typically best consumed within a short time after opening, although the specific chemistry may vary. Some folks consider a sake that's been open, unrefrigerated, for more than a few weeks undrinkable. I don't know if I'm that rigid, but it's a good benchmark. I've seen certain sakes do ok for a few months in the refrigerator. </RelAText>

        <RelAText>It will keep until it doesn't. Eventually it will spoil, but because sake is considerably above the magic number for alcohol concentration to be self preserving when sealed (&gt;12.3% alcohol by volume), so long as you don't let any alcohol tolerant microbes into the bottle, then it will be fine. Smell it first,'if it smells earthy, throw it out, if it smells vinegary, you can use it but it's not rally sake anymore, it's rice wine vinegar. If you want, and if it's say half full, water it down and add a touch of cider vinegar to it. Cider vinegar isn't pasteurized so it will have live acetobacters in it and you can make your own vinegar. You need to cut the sake to half strength though otherwise it's too strong for the acetobacter to grow. </RelAText>

        <RelQBody>While proofing, the crust can appear on the dough balls if in contact with air (oxygen). I tried preventing by damp cloth but it still happens.

        <RelAText>Commercial pizza places usually use plastic dough proofing trays. They interlock and provide a relatively air-tight seal when they stack on top of each other. If you're looking for something that fits in your refrigerator, you should look into Artisan DoughMate trays. They are are 1/2 of the size of standard restaurant sized trays and you can fit a couple in your home fridge (Just under 18&quot; x 14&quot;) They stack with a very good air-tight seal and you just need a lid for the top one. You should be able to fit about six dough balls to a tray. If your only talking 2-3 dough balls then one tray would work, with a lid. But you also can look at aluminum dough pans. Some of these are also stackable with lids, and you put one dough ball into each one. I've often seen people spray the pans with oil so that the dough releases easily, or spray the dough balls so that if they spread into each other while proofing that don't make one massive dough ball. </RelAText>

        <RelAText>Try coating the dough ball with a little olive oil or a non-stick spray.  I don't know if that's the reason why but it's what I always do when baking bread and I never have a crust form during the rise. </RelAText>

        <RelAText>If you insist on using a damp cloth, you have to make it wet again and again, so this is quite cumbersome especially with long proofing times. Much easier is plastic wrap, which doesn't prevent the dough from rising if you use it to cover a sufficiently large bowl. Tightly wrapping the dough itself obviously won't work. My prefered method for these very long raises is a large food-safe plastic container with a lid. It doesn't have to be super-airtight and as I usually do a round of &quot;stretch and fold&quot; or quick punchdown every 12-24 hours I never had a problem with dried or overflowing dough.  </RelAText>

        <RelCText>If the company that puts out the fryer specifically says that 2.5 liters is required... is there a reason you think less would be OK? At the very least, we will need to know the brand and model of the one you have.

        <RelAText>If you need a larger basket to fry the amount of food you want to cook, you need more oil as well. If you don't always want to make that much food (or use that much oil) then you need a smaller vessel for deep-frying, such as a second fryer or a small wok or kadai.  If you put less oil in than the minimum it may not cover the food and/or the oil could overheat, depending on how the fryer manages its temperature settings. Overheating oil can be dangerous and will also burn your food while leaving it raw inside. All around, something to avoid.  You can save and reuse frying oil. There are some good tips at the sites below. Let it cool fully then filter out food particles (I use coffee filters and a funnel for this; it can be a slow drain, be patient) Refrigerate used oil to retard bacterial growth  Stop using it if it looks weird or smells funny! http://www.seriouseats.com/2013/09/ask-the-food-lab-how-many-times-can-i-reuse-fry-oil.html http://extension.psu.edu/food/preservation/faq/questions-and-answers-about-re-using-frying-oil http://www.epicurious.com/expert-advice/you-can-reuse-frying-oil-article </RelAText>

        <RelAText>I'd dare say a small amount of oil can work if there is ample,controlled resupply of heat - why would it make much difference if it is coming from the vessel wall or more oil. However, I found that deep friers are just not designed for that, relying on the oil fill as thermal mass a lot... even or especially the small &quot;fondue&quot; style ones*. TL;DR for the rest of post: Advice on deep frying without using a fryer. Use at your own risk. You are better off with a chip pan/wok/pot and a thermometer for the kind of job where you just want to oil-blanch an ingredient and/or want to minimise oil usage because you do not want to reuse it (eg you want to fry tofu in fresh oil because it tends to be a magnet for the worst flavors it can get from old oil, you want to deep fry something with a strongly spiced and/or unruly rub/breading/batter on it, you want to fry ingredients like carrots or red bell pepper that will discolor the oil, you want to heat the oil very high initially to account for a temperature drop). The largest plate on even a normal electric hob is around 2000W - same as a medium sized home deep fryer, and pots and pans are optimized to transfer these 2000W to what is in them.  If you are not confident with open deep frying, have someone who is work with you for a while - yes it is hazardous, but manageably so - never leave the setup unattended. especially if no food in oil, monitor thermometer closely. always have something made of metal (nothing else) in reach that can cover the pot. always assume something can boil over. keep clutter away from your work area. use really high-heat oil - peanut, refined safflower, soy, rice bran; not some unspecified compound oil with a 180°C warning. be especially careful with induction, can heat a pot with small amounts of liquid in them alarmingly quick. keep the lid off as long as you are heating. if working on gas, ask someone who has experience in doing so for additional advice (overboiling into the burner is an obvious danger!), i'm electric... *the small ones that are partially plastic in construction - never managed to set a grease fire, but I think I would be far more at a loss to control one with these things than in a pot... </RelAText>

        <RelAText>I've used two different home-kitchen deep fryers over the last 18 years or so; one of them was essentially a kettle with a hidden heating element, and the other has a removable heating element that sits under the frying basket. The early one I used, the type with the hidden heating element, really has no minimum other than the basic rule-of-thumb that want at least 3x-4x the volume of oil to food being cooked, so that the oil doesn't cool down too quickly. The basket was the other factor, but if I remember correctly, my basket got pretty close to the bottom of the pan, so that wasn't a major consideration. A more serious model that I now use, which has a feature for filtering/draining oil, a more convincing thermostat, and electronic timers, has some more serious constraints, notably a minimum oil content of about 2.5 liters, and a maximum of maybe a tad over three liters. The minimum is pretty simple to explain: If you use less than 2.5 liters, none of the food will have enough room to float above the basket. You probably won't even cover the heating element without at least a liter of oil in there. Not covering the heating element has some serious consequences, namely the risk of the element glowing and eventually over-heating (based on the thermostat probe placement), oil spatter, and the more practical one of not being able to use the basket. The maximum fill line is an approximation designed to reduce the risk of oil boil-over. Having dealt with a oil boil-over on a friteuse meant for stovetop use in my starving student days in Germany, I can tell you the consequences are unpleasant. I had scars to prove it. High water content in some foods leads to furious bubbling, and if those bubbles manage to carry oil over the side of the pan, bad things happen. </RelAText>

          <RelACText>That was my thought, too -- I've seen way too many fryers where the basket stays an inch or two above the bottom, so a good deal of the oil is more heat-sync than actually coming into contact w/ the food.</RelACText>

        <RelAText>The whole point of deep frying is to use large amounts of oil. You don't want to just coat the food. You really need to have the food swim in a mass of oil much larger than the mass of the food. Else the food will cool down the oil locally and you won't get the desired crust.  So no, as long as you are using a large basket (which holds a large amount of food), you can't do proper deep frying with a small amount of oil. A consumer style deep fryer is probably already on the low side of the correct oil/food ratio.  </RelAText>

A few weeks ago I decided to try substituting the same quantity of home-made  greek-style yogurt in place of the whipping cream. They did not tenderize at all and although being fully cooked, were ‘crunchy’ and not desireable. As an experiment yesterday, I did another batch with part of it done with the original recipe using whipping cream,,  the rest with yogurt. All packets were done on the same grill side-by side with exactly the same time  temp. The packets with whipping cream were done perfectly  again the ones with yogurt were tough. My internet searches have not found any answers as to why this happened. In addition to wanting to understand the science of this difference, can anyone suggest changes I can make to have this substitution work? </RelQBody>

        <RelCText>Without seeing the recipe (permissions issue - it is not a public doc) it is hard to know if something else is going on, but at a minimum, the water content in cream is significantly higher than in Greek-style (strained) yogurt. I suspect that a non-strained yogurt would probably have a similar result to your cream version. You can also &quot;reconstitute&quot; strained yogurt by mixing water or milk in to give it a thinner texture which would also probably work. I doubt it is a chemical reaction, but the recipe would help.</RelCText>

        <RelAText>The amount of grease the meat exudes is dependent upon the amount of fat in the beef. If your beef is lean (10% fat), you will not likely notice a difference in the greasiness in the final product by not straining. If your meat is fatty (ground beef in the US can contain up to 30% fat), then the final product will have noticeable grease. The fat contributes in a good way (IMO) to the flavor and mouth-feel of chili if the meat is in the 15% range.  </RelAText>

        <RelQBody>We've had awful luck with non stick pots and pans no matter how much we spend on them. Most have been Teflon coated. We recently bought a bunch of &quot;high quality&quot;, expensive, porcelain lined aluminum cookwares with enamel coated exteriors. I love the nonstick, easy cleaning so far. They are about 6 months old and no issues. Just wondering what others think of Porcelain vs Teflon cookware. Hope this will last much longer than what I've been use to.  </RelQBody>

        <RelCText>Have to suspect something about your cooking practices contributes to any issues you are having with PTFE. I did finally replace my 20 year old frying pan with a new one a few years back (as much for the new, thicker aluminum part as for a new cooking surface.) I don't use the PTFE for high-heat applications it's unsuited to, and I use non-metallic utensils appropriate for not scratching up the surface. OTOH, the iron skillet I went off to college with is still going strong, but I use them for different things...</RelCText>

        <RelCText>Possibly, I have changed a few things over time. When I brown meat for the slow cooker, I now use cast iron. I've warped a few aluminum non sticks doing this because I add water to the pan to get the browning out to add to the roast. Other than that it seems that most frying pans just wont stay flat and tend to shed their coatings withing 5 or 6 years.</RelCText>

For ice cream/sorbet/gelato/frozen desserts, most &quot;sugar substitutes&quot; (low calorie sweeteners, etc) don't really work, as sugar plays an important structural role in how ice cream turns out.

        <RelAText>I find that the chemical and mechanical reactions between egg-white, egg-yolk and sugar is quite an delicate and complex one. I find that there is even a difference in using white refined cane sugar and white refined beet sugars when baking and the amount of effort of creaming eggs and sugar. Sugar substitutes that claim that they &quot;behave&quot; the same as sugar also don't seem to react in a manner that you'd expect. I would suggest that you try a range of sugars... The worse of them seems to be corn based sugars. The eggs just don't behave at all... </RelAText>

        <RelQSubject>Flavor in avocadoes gone forever?</RelQSubject>
        <RelQBody>I got some made-in-store supermarket guacamole yesterday and it was a new low in bland, watery, flavorless avocado meat. I have read that the reason modern avocadoes taste bland is because they use a variety called a &quot;Hass&quot; avocado that growers prefer because it is resistant to some kinds of blight and it does not spoil as readily as other varieties. Nevertheless, as someone who remembers as a boy getting avocadoes that tasted like, well, avocadoes and actually having good guacamole, it is really discouraging the world takeover of this tasteless drone avocado called the Hass. Also, it seems the Hass itself seems to be getting more bland and more watery year by year. Is there any way to get good avocado varieties of the old type that actually taste good, or have they gone the way of the Dodo? (I should mention that I grew up in San Diego, but now live in Massachusetts so this might be part of the problem; good avocadoes might only be available locally in Southern California.) Update By some further research I have found that apparently large numbers of avocadoes are being exported by Peru, and even though they are Hass avocadoes they are reputedly MUCH more bland than California avocadoes, but also much cheaper. So, this might be the problem, I am getting Peruvian avocadoes. </RelQBody>

        <RelCText>Good tropical fruit in Massachusetts is a rarity on all fronts. Picked underripe and shipped long distances does not ever compare well with picked at/near ripe from the farm up the road. Sometimes we see halfway decent Mexican or Florida avocados.

        <RelAText>You're exactly right in figuring out that part of the problem is having grown up with some of the world's best avocadoes, and then moving up North where decent avocadoes are scarce!  :)  Tasty avocadoes aren't all going the way of the dodo just yet, but you might have to move to Texas or Florida, or check some Mexican markets in your area, to get better avocadoes.  My husband lived in S Calif. as a child. He is an avocado connoisseur like you, as a result. Some of the best S Cali avocadoes are 'Fuerte' variety, which is more flavorful and creamier than Hass. We live in Texas and we get some very good, tasty Mexican avocadoes here- which by the way, are Hass.  But every single avocado I've brought home to hubby, whether from Mexico, Chile, Florida, Arizona, the Caribbean, Hawaii, Guatemala or Peru, ends up being compared unfavorably to those great S Calif. avocados he remembers. We visited a relative in the S Calif. area about 4.5 years ago and hubby had a delicious, fresh S Cali 'Fuerte' variety avocado during that trip--an avocado which he still recalls most fondly.  Personally I tried that same S Cali 'Fuerte' avocado too on that trip and while it was a bit tastier than the Hass avocadoes we currently get in Texas, I didn't find the flavor all THAT much better!  But hubby did prefer it a lot; he likes what he was raised on. Also his palate is more sensitive to bitterness than mine and 'Fuerte' is less bitter than Hass. In recent years, Calif. drought has made the delicious Cali avocadoes, especially the 'Fuerte', nearly impossible to get.  By the way- I lived in Illinois for a while. That state has the same avocado problem as Massachusetts: too far away from where good avocadoes and other tropical fruits are grown, to get avocadoes with decent quality. Whatever does survive the shipping journey that far North is usually picked much too green. Around the holidays such as Christmas and 16 de Septiembre and 5 de Mayo etc., there was ONE Mexican food store in Chicago that got some fresh, air-flown ripe Mexican avocadoes for sale just for these special days..at $5 each!   Mom who was raised in Texas was desperate for a good avocado because they are almost nonexistent in Chicago, so she bought 2 of those $5 avocados for Christmas dinner and said it was worth it. I had a small taste in my salad, it was great but geez $5 a piece LOL! I'm real glad we left Chicago and moved to Texas soon after that! I wouldn't count on S. California's avocado crop doing well anytime in the near future, as that area is likely to only have worse and worse water shortages and drought problems as time goes forward.  So perhaps, sadly, the 'Fuerte' avocadoes and the other delicious S Cali avocadoes you were raised on are going the way of the dodo. I hope not because they are very good avocadoes and it's always nice to be able to get USA grown tropical fruits. But unless some amazing advances in water and climate management are made to save the Cali avocado farms from extinction, your delicious S Cali grown avocadoes may become nothing more than a fond memory. </RelAText>

        <RelAText>If you have room to place the Wellingtons on the same shelf, you simply cook them in the same way as you would a single one. Conventional ovens do not work like microwaves - the amount of stuff in the oven makes no difference, providing air flow is maintained and you don't have something large right up at the top or bottom blocking an element. Fan ovens are especially useful as they actively circulate the heat around the oven cavity, so you can cook things on two different levels with fairly good consistency. </RelAText>

        <RelAText>I recon it has formed like a cake after cooling. The best option you have is to take a big chunk of it in a microwaveable container (making sure that you are not breaking the rice grains) and sprinkling with some water. Then cover with a cling film and microwave for 3-4 minutes from cold. Your rice grains will separate because of the extra moisture from the sprinkled water and the Pulao will become slightly moist.   But yes, Pulao is a dry dish and needs to be eaten with a side like Raita or Salan. </RelAText>

        <RelAText>Pulao is usually a &quot;dry&quot; dish without any gravy/sauce left in it when it finishes cooking. If the rice seems to be fully cooked and the individual grains do not seem to be under cooked or slightly crunchy then I think it is probably correct.  Many people serve raita (I like a simple yoghurt-onion-tomato mix with some chili powder and salt) and green coriander chutney along with pulao or biryani which helps to make the overall experience less dry. I usually cook the marinade as well to make a gravy/salan to serve on the side when I make chicken biryani. </RelAText>

        <RelAText>Unless contaminated by, say, drinking straight out of the bottle, it will likely be safe to consume, but it will probably have deteriorated in quality. Sake which is no longer appealing to drink may be suitable for use in cooking; if you're not accustomed to cooking with sake, consider something simple, like potatoes simmered with a modest amount of water, sake, salt  pepper, soy sauce and butter. Low-alcohol beverages, whether fermented or slightly fortified, tend to deteriorate in quality over time, although they will become stale less slowly if their containers are sealed airtight and chilled. Port, marsala, sherry, vermouth, wine and sake all typically best consumed within a short time after opening, although the specific chemistry may vary. Some folks consider a sake that's been open, unrefrigerated, for more than a few weeks undrinkable. I don't know if I'm that rigid, but it's a good benchmark. I've seen certain sakes do ok for a few months in the refrigerator. </RelAText>

        <RelAText>It will keep until it doesn't. Eventually it will spoil, but because sake is considerably above the magic number for alcohol concentration to be self preserving when sealed (&gt;12.3% alcohol by volume), so long as you don't let any alcohol tolerant microbes into the bottle, then it will be fine. Smell it first,'if it smells earthy, throw it out, if it smells vinegary, you can use it but it's not rally sake anymore, it's rice wine vinegar. If you want, and if it's say half full, water it down and add a touch of cider vinegar to it. Cider vinegar isn't pasteurized so it will have live acetobacters in it and you can make your own vinegar. You need to cut the sake to half strength though otherwise it's too strong for the acetobacter to grow. </RelAText>

        <RelQBody>While proofing, the crust can appear on the dough balls if in contact with air (oxygen). I tried preventing by damp cloth but it still happens. The only thing that works 100% is plastic foil wrap, but that would prevent the dough from rising.

        <RelAText>Commercial pizza places usually use plastic dough proofing trays. They interlock and provide a relatively air-tight seal when they stack on top of each other. If you're looking for something that fits in your refrigerator, you should look into Artisan DoughMate trays. They are are 1/2 of the size of standard restaurant sized trays and you can fit a couple in your home fridge (Just under 18&quot; x 14&quot;) They stack with a very good air-tight seal and you just need a lid for the top one. You should be able to fit about six dough balls to a tray. If your only talking 2-3 dough balls then one tray would work, with a lid. But you also can look at aluminum dough pans. Some of these are also stackable with lids, and you put one dough ball into each one. I've often seen people spray the pans with oil so that the dough releases easily, or spray the dough balls so that if they spread into each other while proofing that don't make one massive dough ball. </RelAText>

        <RelAText>Try coating the dough ball with a little olive oil or a non-stick spray.  I don't know if that's the reason why but it's what I always do when baking bread and I never have a crust form during the rise. </RelAText>

        <RelAText>If you insist on using a damp cloth, you have to make it wet again and again, so this is quite cumbersome especially with long proofing times. Much easier is plastic wrap, which doesn't prevent the dough from rising if you use it to cover a sufficiently large bowl. Tightly wrapping the dough itself obviously won't work. My prefered method for these very long raises is a large food-safe plastic container with a lid. It doesn't have to be super-airtight and as I usually do a round of &quot;stretch and fold&quot; or quick punchdown every 12-24 hours I never had a problem with dried or overflowing dough.  </RelAText>

        <RelCText>If the company that puts out the fryer specifically says that 2.5 liters is required... is there a reason you think less would be OK? At the very least, we will need to know the brand and model of the one you have.

        <RelAText>If you need a larger basket to fry the amount of food you want to cook, you need more oil as well. If you don't always want to make that much food (or use that much oil) then you need a smaller vessel for deep-frying, such as a second fryer or a small wok or kadai.  If you put less oil in than the minimum it may not cover the food and/or the oil could overheat, depending on how the fryer manages its temperature settings. Overheating oil can be dangerous and will also burn your food while leaving it raw inside. All around, something to avoid.  You can save and reuse frying oil. There are some good tips at the sites below. Let it cool fully then filter out food particles (I use coffee filters and a funnel for this; it can be a slow drain, be patient) Refrigerate used oil to retard bacterial growth  Stop using it if it looks weird or smells funny! http://www.seriouseats.com/2013/09/ask-the-food-lab-how-many-times-can-i-reuse-fry-oil.html http://extension.psu.edu/food/preservation/faq/questions-and-answers-about-re-using-frying-oil http://www.epicurious.com/expert-advice/you-can-reuse-frying-oil-article </RelAText>

        <RelAText>I'd dare say a small amount of oil can work if there is ample,controlled resupply of heat - why would it make much difference if it is coming from the vessel wall or more oil. However, I found that deep friers are just not designed for that, relying on the oil fill as thermal mass a lot... even or especially the small &quot;fondue&quot; style ones*. TL;DR for the rest of post: Advice on deep frying without using a fryer. Use at your own risk. You are better off with a chip pan/wok/pot and a thermometer for the kind of job where you just want to oil-blanch an ingredient and/or want to minimise oil usage because you do not want to reuse it (eg you want to fry tofu in fresh oil because it tends to be a magnet for the worst flavors it can get from old oil, you want to deep fry something with a strongly spiced and/or unruly rub/breading/batter on it, you want to fry ingredients like carrots or red bell pepper that will discolor the oil, you want to heat the oil very high initially to account for a temperature drop). The largest plate on even a normal electric hob is around 2000W - same as a medium sized home deep fryer, and pots and pans are optimized to transfer these 2000W to what is in them.  If you are not confident with open deep frying, have someone who is work with you for a while - yes it is hazardous, but manageably so - never leave the setup unattended. especially if no food in oil, monitor thermometer closely. always have something made of metal (nothing else) in reach that can cover the pot. always assume something can boil over. keep clutter away from your work area. use really high-heat oil - peanut, refined safflower, soy, rice bran; not some unspecified compound oil with a 180°C warning. be especially careful with induction, can heat a pot with small amounts of liquid in them alarmingly quick. keep the lid off as long as you are heating. if working on gas, ask someone who has experience in doing so for additional advice (overboiling into the burner is an obvious danger!), i'm electric... *the small ones that are partially plastic in construction - never managed to set a grease fire, but I think I would be far more at a loss to control one with these things than in a pot... </RelAText>

        <RelAText>I've used two different home-kitchen deep fryers over the last 18 years or so; one of them was essentially a kettle with a hidden heating element, and the other has a removable heating element that sits under the frying basket. The early one I used, the type with the hidden heating element, really has no minimum other than the basic rule-of-thumb that want at least 3x-4x the volume of oil to food being cooked, so that the oil doesn't cool down too quickly. The basket was the other factor, but if I remember correctly, my basket got pretty close to the bottom of the pan, so that wasn't a major consideration. A more serious model that I now use, which has a feature for filtering/draining oil, a more convincing thermostat, and electronic timers, has some more serious constraints, notably a minimum oil content of about 2.5 liters, and a maximum of maybe a tad over three liters. The minimum is pretty simple to explain: If you use less than 2.5 liters, none of the food will have enough room to float above the basket. You probably won't even cover the heating element without at least a liter of oil in there. Not covering the heating element has some serious consequences, namely the risk of the element glowing and eventually over-heating (based on the thermostat probe placement), oil spatter, and the more practical one of not being able to use the basket. The maximum fill line is an approximation designed to reduce the risk of oil boil-over. Having dealt with a oil boil-over on a friteuse meant for stovetop use in my starving student days in Germany, I can tell you the consequences are unpleasant. I had scars to prove it. High water content in some foods leads to furious bubbling, and if those bubbles manage to carry oil over the side of the pan, bad things happen. </RelAText>

          <RelACText>That was my thought, too -- I've seen way too many fryers where the basket stays an inch or two above the bottom, so a good deal of the oil is more heat-sync than actually coming into contact w/ the food.</RelACText>

        <RelAText>The whole point of deep frying is to use large amounts of oil. You don't want to just coat the food. You really need to have the food swim in a mass of oil much larger than the mass of the food. Else the food will cool down the oil locally and you won't get the desired crust.  So no, as long as you are using a large basket (which holds a large amount of food), you can't do proper deep frying with a small amount of oil. A consumer style deep fryer is probably already on the low side of the correct oil/food ratio.  </RelAText>

A few weeks ago I decided to try substituting the same quantity of home-made  greek-style yogurt in place of the whipping cream. They did not tenderize at all and although being fully cooked, were ‘crunchy’ and not desireable. As an experiment yesterday, I did another batch with part of it done with the original recipe using whipping cream,,  the rest with yogurt. All packets were done on the same grill side-by side with exactly the same time  temp. The packets with whipping cream were done perfectly  again the ones with yogurt were tough. My internet searches have not found any answers as to why this happened.

        <RelCText>Without seeing the recipe (permissions issue - it is not a public doc) it is hard to know if something else is going on, but at a minimum, the water content in cream is significantly higher than in Greek-style (strained) yogurt. I suspect that a non-strained yogurt would probably have a similar result to your cream version. You can also &quot;reconstitute&quot; strained yogurt by mixing water or milk in to give it a thinner texture which would also probably work. I doubt it is a chemical reaction, but the recipe would help.</RelCText>

        <RelAText>The amount of grease the meat exudes is dependent upon the amount of fat in the beef. If your beef is lean (10% fat), you will not likely notice a difference in the greasiness in the final product by not straining. If your meat is fatty (ground beef in the US can contain up to 30% fat), then the final product will have noticeable grease. The fat contributes in a good way (IMO) to the flavor and mouth-feel of chili if the meat is in the 15% range.  </RelAText>

        <RelCText>Have to suspect something about your cooking practices contributes to any issues you are having with PTFE. I did finally replace my 20 year old frying pan with a new one a few years back (as much for the new, thicker aluminum part as for a new cooking surface.) I don't use the PTFE for high-heat applications it's unsuited to, and I use non-metallic utensils appropriate for not scratching up the surface. OTOH, the iron skillet I went off to college with is still going strong, but I use them for different things...</RelCText>

        <RelCText>Possibly, I have changed a few things over time. When I brown meat for the slow cooker, I now use cast iron. I've warped a few aluminum non sticks doing this because I add water to the pan to get the browning out to add to the roast. Other than that it seems that most frying pans just wont stay flat and tend to shed their coatings withing 5 or 6 years.</RelCText>

        <RelAText>Use maple sugar.

For ice cream/sorbet/gelato/frozen desserts, most &quot;sugar substitutes&quot; (low calorie sweeteners, etc) don't really work, as sugar plays an important structural role in how ice cream turns out.

        <RelAText>I find that the chemical and mechanical reactions between egg-white, egg-yolk and sugar is quite an delicate and complex one. I find that there is even a difference in using white refined cane sugar and white refined beet sugars when baking and the amount of effort of creaming eggs and sugar. Sugar substitutes that claim that they &quot;behave&quot; the same as sugar also don't seem to react in a manner that you'd expect. I would suggest that you try a range of sugars... The worse of them seems to be corn based sugars. The eggs just don't behave at all... </RelAText>

        <RelQSubject>Flavor in avocadoes gone forever?</RelQSubject>
        <RelQBody>I got some made-in-store supermarket guacamole yesterday and it was a new low in bland, watery, flavorless avocado meat. I have read that the reason modern avocadoes taste bland is because they use a variety called a &quot;Hass&quot; avocado that growers prefer because it is resistant to some kinds of blight and it does not spoil as readily as other varieties. Nevertheless, as someone who remembers as a boy getting avocadoes that tasted like, well, avocadoes and actually having good guacamole, it is really discouraging the world takeover of this tasteless drone avocado called the Hass. Also, it seems the Hass itself seems to be getting more bland and more watery year by year. Is there any way to get good avocado varieties of the old type that actually taste good, or have they gone the way of the Dodo? (I should mention that I grew up in San Diego, but now live in Massachusetts so this might be part of the problem; good avocadoes might only be available locally in Southern California.) Update By some further research I have found that apparently large numbers of avocadoes are being exported by Peru, and even though they are Hass avocadoes they are reputedly MUCH more bland than California avocadoes, but also much cheaper. So, this might be the problem, I am getting Peruvian avocadoes. </RelQBody>

        <RelAText>You're exactly right in figuring out that part of the problem is having grown up with some of the world's best avocadoes, and then moving up North where decent avocadoes are scarce!  :)  Tasty avocadoes aren't all going the way of the dodo just yet, but you might have to move to Texas or Florida, or check some Mexican markets in your area, to get better avocadoes.  My husband lived in S Calif. as a child. He is an avocado connoisseur like you, as a result. Some of the best S Cali avocadoes are 'Fuerte' variety, which is more flavorful and creamier than Hass. We live in Texas and we get some very good, tasty Mexican avocadoes here- which by the way, are Hass.  But every single avocado I've brought home to hubby, whether from Mexico, Chile, Florida, Arizona, the Caribbean, Hawaii, Guatemala or Peru, ends up being compared unfavorably to those great S Calif. avocados he remembers. We visited a relative in the S Calif. area about 4.5 years ago and hubby had a delicious, fresh S Cali 'Fuerte' variety avocado during that trip--an avocado which he still recalls most fondly.  Personally I tried that same S Cali 'Fuerte' avocado too on that trip and while it was a bit tastier than the Hass avocadoes we currently get in Texas, I didn't find the flavor all THAT much better!  But hubby did prefer it a lot; he likes what he was raised on. Also his palate is more sensitive to bitterness than mine and 'Fuerte' is less bitter than Hass. In recent years, Calif. drought has made the delicious Cali avocadoes, especially the 'Fuerte', nearly impossible to get.  By the way- I lived in Illinois for a while. That state has the same avocado problem as Massachusetts: too far away from where good avocadoes and other tropical fruits are grown, to get avocadoes with decent quality. Whatever does survive the shipping journey that far North is usually picked much too green. Around the holidays such as Christmas and 16 de Septiembre and 5 de Mayo etc., there was ONE Mexican food store in Chicago that got some fresh, air-flown ripe Mexican avocadoes for sale just for these special days..at $5 each!   Mom who was raised in Texas was desperate for a good avocado because they are almost nonexistent in Chicago, so she bought 2 of those $5 avocados for Christmas dinner and said it was worth it. I had a small taste in my salad, it was great but geez $5 a piece LOL! I'm real glad we left Chicago and moved to Texas soon after that! I wouldn't count on S. California's avocado crop doing well anytime in the near future, as that area is likely to only have worse and worse water shortages and drought problems as time goes forward.  So perhaps, sadly, the 'Fuerte' avocadoes and the other delicious S Cali avocadoes you were raised on are going the way of the dodo. I hope not because they are very good avocadoes and it's always nice to be able to get USA grown tropical fruits. But unless some amazing advances in water and climate management are made to save the Cali avocado farms from extinction, your delicious S Cali grown avocadoes may become nothing more than a fond memory. </RelAText>

        <RelAText>If you have room to place the Wellingtons on the same shelf, you simply cook them in the same way as you would a single one. Conventional ovens do not work like microwaves - the amount of stuff in the oven makes no difference, providing air flow is maintained and you don't have something large right up at the top or bottom blocking an element. Fan ovens are especially useful as they actively circulate the heat around the oven cavity, so you can cook things on two different levels with fairly good consistency. </RelAText>

        <RelQSubject>Remedy for Dry Chicken Yakhni pulao ?</RelQSubject>
        <RelQBody>My question is that today I prepared Chicken Yakhni Pulao,it tasted good but it is very dry, i mean the youghurt and the masala got absorbed in the rice very much. And i have made lots of it, it is also fully cooked. So does anyone know how should i make the fully cooked pulao little juicy ? As it is difficult to eat the dry pulao(I may require another curry with it) </RelQBody>

        <RelAText>I recon it has formed like a cake after cooling. The best option you have is to take a big chunk of it in a microwaveable container (making sure that you are not breaking the rice grains) and sprinkling with some water. Then cover with a cling film and microwave for 3-4 minutes from cold. Your rice grains will separate because of the extra moisture from the sprinkled water and the Pulao will become slightly moist.   But yes, Pulao is a dry dish and needs to be eaten with a side like Raita or Salan. </RelAText>

        <RelAText>Pulao is usually a &quot;dry&quot; dish without any gravy/sauce left in it when it finishes cooking. If the rice seems to be fully cooked and the individual grains do not seem to be under cooked or slightly crunchy then I think it is probably correct.  Many people serve raita (I like a simple yoghurt-onion-tomato mix with some chili powder and salt) and green coriander chutney along with pulao or biryani which helps to make the overall experience less dry. I usually cook the marinade as well to make a gravy/salan to serve on the side when I make chicken biryani. </RelAText>

        <RelAText>Unless contaminated by, say, drinking straight out of the bottle, it will likely be safe to consume, but it will probably have deteriorated in quality. Sake which is no longer appealing to drink may be suitable for use in cooking; if you're not accustomed to cooking with sake, consider something simple, like potatoes simmered with a modest amount of water, sake, salt  pepper, soy sauce and butter. Low-alcohol beverages, whether fermented or slightly fortified, tend to deteriorate in quality over time, although they will become stale less slowly if their containers are sealed airtight and chilled. Port, marsala, sherry, vermouth, wine and sake all typically best consumed within a short time after opening, although the specific chemistry may vary. Some folks consider a sake that's been open, unrefrigerated, for more than a few weeks undrinkable. I don't know if I'm that rigid, but it's a good benchmark. I've seen certain sakes do ok for a few months in the refrigerator. </RelAText>

        <RelAText>It will keep until it doesn't. Eventually it will spoil, but because sake is considerably above the magic number for alcohol concentration to be self preserving when sealed (&gt;12.3% alcohol by volume), so long as you don't let any alcohol tolerant microbes into the bottle, then it will be fine. Smell it first,'if it smells earthy, throw it out, if it smells vinegary, you can use it but it's not rally sake anymore, it's rice wine vinegar. If you want, and if it's say half full, water it down and add a touch of cider vinegar to it. Cider vinegar isn't pasteurized so it will have live acetobacters in it and you can make your own vinegar. You need to cut the sake to half strength though otherwise it's too strong for the acetobacter to grow. </RelAText>

        <RelAText>Commercial pizza places usually use plastic dough proofing trays. They interlock and provide a relatively air-tight seal when they stack on top of each other. If you're looking for something that fits in your refrigerator, you should look into Artisan DoughMate trays. They are are 1/2 of the size of standard restaurant sized trays and you can fit a couple in your home fridge (Just under 18&quot; x 14&quot;) They stack with a very good air-tight seal and you just need a lid for the top one. You should be able to fit about six dough balls to a tray. If your only talking 2-3 dough balls then one tray would work, with a lid. But you also can look at aluminum dough pans. Some of these are also stackable with lids, and you put one dough ball into each one. I've often seen people spray the pans with oil so that the dough releases easily, or spray the dough balls so that if they spread into each other while proofing that don't make one massive dough ball. </RelAText>

        <RelAText>Try coating the dough ball with a little olive oil or a non-stick spray.  I don't know if that's the reason why but it's what I always do when baking bread and I never have a crust form during the rise. </RelAText>

        <RelAText>If you insist on using a damp cloth, you have to make it wet again and again, so this is quite cumbersome especially with long proofing times. Much easier is plastic wrap, which doesn't prevent the dough from rising if you use it to cover a sufficiently large bowl. Tightly wrapping the dough itself obviously won't work. My prefered method for these very long raises is a large food-safe plastic container with a lid. It doesn't have to be super-airtight and as I usually do a round of &quot;stretch and fold&quot; or quick punchdown every 12-24 hours I never had a problem with dried or overflowing dough.  </RelAText>

        <RelAText>If you need a larger basket to fry the amount of food you want to cook, you need more oil as well. If you don't always want to make that much food (or use that much oil) then you need a smaller vessel for deep-frying, such as a second fryer or a small wok or kadai.  If you put less oil in than the minimum it may not cover the food and/or the oil could overheat, depending on how the fryer manages its temperature settings. Overheating oil can be dangerous and will also burn your food while leaving it raw inside. All around, something to avoid.  You can save and reuse frying oil. There are some good tips at the sites below. Let it cool fully then filter out food particles (I use coffee filters and a funnel for this; it can be a slow drain, be patient) Refrigerate used oil to retard bacterial growth  Stop using it if it looks weird or smells funny! http://www.seriouseats.com/2013/09/ask-the-food-lab-how-many-times-can-i-reuse-fry-oil.html http://extension.psu.edu/food/preservation/faq/questions-and-answers-about-re-using-frying-oil http://www.epicurious.com/expert-advice/you-can-reuse-frying-oil-article </RelAText>

        <RelAText>I'd dare say a small amount of oil can work if there is ample,controlled resupply of heat - why would it make much difference if it is coming from the vessel wall or more oil. However, I found that deep friers are just not designed for that, relying on the oil fill as thermal mass a lot... even or especially the small &quot;fondue&quot; style ones*. TL;DR for the rest of post: Advice on deep frying without using a fryer. Use at your own risk. You are better off with a chip pan/wok/pot and a thermometer for the kind of job where you just want to oil-blanch an ingredient and/or want to minimise oil usage because you do not want to reuse it (eg you want to fry tofu in fresh oil because it tends to be a magnet for the worst flavors it can get from old oil, you want to deep fry something with a strongly spiced and/or unruly rub/breading/batter on it, you want to fry ingredients like carrots or red bell pepper that will discolor the oil, you want to heat the oil very high initially to account for a temperature drop). The largest plate on even a normal electric hob is around 2000W - same as a medium sized home deep fryer, and pots and pans are optimized to transfer these 2000W to what is in them.  If you are not confident with open deep frying, have someone who is work with you for a while - yes it is hazardous, but manageably so - never leave the setup unattended. especially if no food in oil, monitor thermometer closely. always have something made of metal (nothing else) in reach that can cover the pot. always assume something can boil over. keep clutter away from your work area. use really high-heat oil - peanut, refined safflower, soy, rice bran; not some unspecified compound oil with a 180°C warning. be especially careful with induction, can heat a pot with small amounts of liquid in them alarmingly quick. keep the lid off as long as you are heating. if working on gas, ask someone who has experience in doing so for additional advice (overboiling into the burner is an obvious danger!), i'm electric... *the small ones that are partially plastic in construction - never managed to set a grease fire, but I think I would be far more at a loss to control one with these things than in a pot... </RelAText>

        <RelAText>I've used two different home-kitchen deep fryers over the last 18 years or so; one of them was essentially a kettle with a hidden heating element, and the other has a removable heating element that sits under the frying basket. The early one I used, the type with the hidden heating element, really has no minimum other than the basic rule-of-thumb that want at least 3x-4x the volume of oil to food being cooked, so that the oil doesn't cool down too quickly. The basket was the other factor, but if I remember correctly, my basket got pretty close to the bottom of the pan, so that wasn't a major consideration. A more serious model that I now use, which has a feature for filtering/draining oil, a more convincing thermostat, and electronic timers, has some more serious constraints, notably a minimum oil content of about 2.5 liters, and a maximum of maybe a tad over three liters. The minimum is pretty simple to explain: If you use less than 2.5 liters, none of the food will have enough room to float above the basket. You probably won't even cover the heating element without at least a liter of oil in there. Not covering the heating element has some serious consequences, namely the risk of the element glowing and eventually over-heating (based on the thermostat probe placement), oil spatter, and the more practical one of not being able to use the basket. The maximum fill line is an approximation designed to reduce the risk of oil boil-over. Having dealt with a oil boil-over on a friteuse meant for stovetop use in my starving student days in Germany, I can tell you the consequences are unpleasant. I had scars to prove it. High water content in some foods leads to furious bubbling, and if those bubbles manage to carry oil over the side of the pan, bad things happen. </RelAText>

          <RelACText>That was my thought, too -- I've seen way too many fryers where the basket stays an inch or two above the bottom, so a good deal of the oil is more heat-sync than actually coming into contact w/ the food.</RelACText>

        <RelAText>The whole point of deep frying is to use large amounts of oil. You don't want to just coat the food. You really need to have the food swim in a mass of oil much larger than the mass of the food. Else the food will cool down the oil locally and you won't get the desired crust.  So no, as long as you are using a large basket (which holds a large amount of food), you can't do proper deep frying with a small amount of oil. A consumer style deep fryer is probably already on the low side of the correct oil/food ratio.  </RelAText>

        <RelQBody>I have a favorite tried  true recipe that I simply call ‘foil potatoes’.  recipe link: http://www.evernote.com/shard/s1/sh/048c56cc-1481-48b2-89e6-88e897da651a/b0c036a6448b07e0a486f77acf2111cb This has been made multiple times with consistently good results. A few weeks ago I decided to try substituting the same quantity of home-made  greek-style yogurt in place of the whipping cream. They did not tenderize at all and although being fully cooked, were ‘crunchy’ and not desireable. As an experiment yesterday, I did another batch with part of it done with the original recipe using whipping cream,,  the rest with yogurt. All packets were done on the same grill side-by side with exactly the same time  temp. The packets with whipping cream were done perfectly  again the ones with yogurt were tough. My internet searches have not found any answers as to why this happened. In addition to wanting to understand the science of this difference, can anyone suggest changes I can make to have this substitution work? </RelQBody>

        <RelCText>Without seeing the recipe (permissions issue - it is not a public doc) it is hard to know if something else is going on, but at a minimum, the water content in cream is significantly higher than in Greek-style (strained) yogurt. I suspect that a non-strained yogurt would probably have a similar result to your cream version. You can also &quot;reconstitute&quot; strained yogurt by mixing water or milk in to give it a thinner texture which would also probably work. I doubt it is a chemical reaction, but the recipe would help.</RelCText>

        <RelAText>The amount of grease the meat exudes is dependent upon the amount of fat in the beef. If your beef is lean (10% fat), you will not likely notice a difference in the greasiness in the final product by not straining. If your meat is fatty (ground beef in the US can contain up to 30% fat), then the final product will have noticeable grease. The fat contributes in a good way (IMO) to the flavor and mouth-feel of chili if the meat is in the 15% range.  </RelAText>

        <RelCText>Have to suspect something about your cooking practices contributes to any issues you are having with PTFE. I did finally replace my 20 year old frying pan with a new one a few years back (as much for the new, thicker aluminum part as for a new cooking surface.) I don't use the PTFE for high-heat applications it's unsuited to, and I use non-metallic utensils appropriate for not scratching up the surface. OTOH, the iron skillet I went off to college with is still going strong, but I use them for different things...</RelCText>

        <RelCText>Possibly, I have changed a few things over time. When I brown meat for the slow cooker, I now use cast iron. I've warped a few aluminum non sticks doing this because I add water to the pan to get the browning out to add to the roast. Other than that it seems that most frying pans just wont stay flat and tend to shed their coatings withing 5 or 6 years.</RelCText>

        <RelAText>I find that the chemical and mechanical reactions between egg-white, egg-yolk and sugar is quite an delicate and complex one. I find that there is even a difference in using white refined cane sugar and white refined beet sugars when baking and the amount of effort of creaming eggs and sugar. Sugar substitutes that claim that they &quot;behave&quot; the same as sugar also don't seem to react in a manner that you'd expect. I would suggest that you try a range of sugars...

        <RelQBody>I got some made-in-store supermarket guacamole yesterday and it was a new low in bland, watery, flavorless avocado meat. I have read that the reason modern avocadoes taste bland is because they use a variety called a &quot;Hass&quot; avocado that growers prefer because it is resistant to some kinds of blight and it does not spoil as readily as other varieties. Nevertheless, as someone who remembers as a boy getting avocadoes that tasted like, well, avocadoes and actually having good guacamole, it is really discouraging the world takeover of this tasteless drone avocado called the Hass. Also, it seems the Hass itself seems to be getting more bland and more watery year by year. Is there any way to get good avocado varieties of the old type that actually taste good, or have they gone the way of the Dodo? (I should mention that I grew up in San Diego, but now live in Massachusetts so this might be part of the problem; good avocadoes might only be available locally in Southern California.) Update By some further research I have found that apparently large numbers of avocadoes are being exported by Peru, and even though they are Hass avocadoes they are reputedly MUCH more bland than California avocadoes, but also much cheaper. So, this might be the problem, I am getting Peruvian avocadoes. </RelQBody>

        <RelCText>CA is in the midst of a drought. Haven't seen a good avocado from there all year. However, before the local Mexican market burned down, they were getting *Mexican grown avocados* the size of softballs that'd make your mouth water for more; cheap too!

        <RelCText>Good tropical fruit in Massachusetts is a rarity on all fronts. Picked underripe and shipped long distances does not ever compare well with picked at/near ripe from the farm up the road. Sometimes we see halfway decent Mexican or Florida avocados. Halfway decent is about as good as it gets.</RelCText>

        <RelAText>You're exactly right in figuring out that part of the problem is having grown up with some of the world's best avocadoes, and then moving up North where decent avocadoes are scarce!  :)  Tasty avocadoes aren't all going the way of the dodo just yet, but you might have to move to Texas or Florida, or check some Mexican markets in your area, to get better avocadoes.  My husband lived in S Calif. as a child. He is an avocado connoisseur like you, as a result. Some of the best S Cali avocadoes are 'Fuerte' variety, which is more flavorful and creamier than Hass. We live in Texas and we get some very good, tasty Mexican avocadoes here- which by the way, are Hass.  But every single avocado I've brought home to hubby, whether from Mexico, Chile, Florida, Arizona, the Caribbean, Hawaii, Guatemala or Peru, ends up being compared unfavorably to those great S Calif. avocados he remembers. We visited a relative in the S Calif. area about 4.5 years ago and hubby had a delicious, fresh S Cali 'Fuerte' variety avocado during that trip--an avocado which he still recalls most fondly.  Personally I tried that same S Cali 'Fuerte' avocado too on that trip and while it was a bit tastier than the Hass avocadoes we currently get in Texas, I didn't find the flavor all THAT much better!  But hubby did prefer it a lot; he likes what he was raised on. Also his palate is more sensitive to bitterness than mine and 'Fuerte' is less bitter than Hass. In recent years, Calif. drought has made the delicious Cali avocadoes, especially the 'Fuerte', nearly impossible to get.  By the way- I lived in Illinois for a while. That state has the same avocado problem as Massachusetts: too far away from where good avocadoes and other tropical fruits are grown, to get avocadoes with decent quality. Whatever does survive the shipping journey that far North is usually picked much too green. Around the holidays such as Christmas and 16 de Septiembre and 5 de Mayo etc., there was ONE Mexican food store in Chicago that got some fresh, air-flown ripe Mexican avocadoes for sale just for these special days..at $5 each!   Mom who was raised in Texas was desperate for a good avocado because they are almost nonexistent in Chicago, so she bought 2 of those $5 avocados for Christmas dinner and said it was worth it. I had a small taste in my salad, it was great but geez $5 a piece LOL! I'm real glad we left Chicago and moved to Texas soon after that! I wouldn't count on S. California's avocado crop doing well anytime in the near future, as that area is likely to only have worse and worse water shortages and drought problems as time goes forward.  So perhaps, sadly, the 'Fuerte' avocadoes and the other delicious S Cali avocadoes you were raised on are going the way of the dodo. I hope not because they are very good avocadoes and it's always nice to be able to get USA grown tropical fruits. But unless some amazing advances in water and climate management are made to save the Cali avocado farms from extinction, your delicious S Cali grown avocadoes may become nothing more than a fond memory. </RelAText>

        <RelAText>If you have room to place the Wellingtons on the same shelf, you simply cook them in the same way as you would a single one. Conventional ovens do not work like microwaves - the amount of stuff in the oven makes no difference, providing air flow is maintained and you don't have something large right up at the top or bottom blocking an element. Fan ovens are especially useful as they actively circulate the heat around the oven cavity, so you can cook things on two different levels with fairly good consistency. </RelAText>

        <RelAText>I recon it has formed like a cake after cooling. The best option you have is to take a big chunk of it in a microwaveable container (making sure that you are not breaking the rice grains) and sprinkling with some water. Then cover with a cling film and microwave for 3-4 minutes from cold. Your rice grains will separate because of the extra moisture from the sprinkled water and the Pulao will become slightly moist.   But yes, Pulao is a dry dish and needs to be eaten with a side like Raita or Salan. </RelAText>

        <RelAText>Pulao is usually a &quot;dry&quot; dish without any gravy/sauce left in it when it finishes cooking. If the rice seems to be fully cooked and the individual grains do not seem to be under cooked or slightly crunchy then I think it is probably correct.  Many people serve raita (I like a simple yoghurt-onion-tomato mix with some chili powder and salt) and green coriander chutney along with pulao or biryani which helps to make the overall experience less dry. I usually cook the marinade as well to make a gravy/salan to serve on the side when I make chicken biryani. </RelAText>

        <RelAText>Unless contaminated by, say, drinking straight out of the bottle, it will likely be safe to consume, but it will probably have deteriorated in quality. Sake which is no longer appealing to drink may be suitable for use in cooking; if you're not accustomed to cooking with sake, consider something simple, like potatoes simmered with a modest amount of water, sake, salt  pepper, soy sauce and butter. Low-alcohol beverages, whether fermented or slightly fortified, tend to deteriorate in quality over time, although they will become stale less slowly if their containers are sealed airtight and chilled. Port, marsala, sherry, vermouth, wine and sake all typically best consumed within a short time after opening, although the specific chemistry may vary. Some folks consider a sake that's been open, unrefrigerated, for more than a few weeks undrinkable. I don't know if I'm that rigid, but it's a good benchmark. I've seen certain sakes do ok for a few months in the refrigerator. </RelAText>

        <RelAText>It will keep until it doesn't. Eventually it will spoil, but because sake is considerably above the magic number for alcohol concentration to be self preserving when sealed (&gt;12.3% alcohol by volume), so long as you don't let any alcohol tolerant microbes into the bottle, then it will be fine. Smell it first,'if it smells earthy, throw it out, if it smells vinegary, you can use it but it's not rally sake anymore, it's rice wine vinegar. If you want, and if it's say half full, water it down and add a touch of cider vinegar to it. Cider vinegar isn't pasteurized so it will have live acetobacters in it and you can make your own vinegar. You need to cut the sake to half strength though otherwise it's too strong for the acetobacter to grow. </RelAText>

        <RelAText>Commercial pizza places usually use plastic dough proofing trays. They interlock and provide a relatively air-tight seal when they stack on top of each other. If you're looking for something that fits in your refrigerator, you should look into Artisan DoughMate trays. They are are 1/2 of the size of standard restaurant sized trays and you can fit a couple in your home fridge (Just under 18&quot; x 14&quot;) They stack with a very good air-tight seal and you just need a lid for the top one. You should be able to fit about six dough balls to a tray. If your only talking 2-3 dough balls then one tray would work, with a lid. But you also can look at aluminum dough pans. Some of these are also stackable with lids, and you put one dough ball into each one. I've often seen people spray the pans with oil so that the dough releases easily, or spray the dough balls so that if they spread into each other while proofing that don't make one massive dough ball. </RelAText>

        <RelAText>Try coating the dough ball with a little olive oil or a non-stick spray.  I don't know if that's the reason why but it's what I always do when baking bread and I never have a crust form during the rise. </RelAText>

        <RelAText>If you insist on using a damp cloth, you have to make it wet again and again, so this is quite cumbersome especially with long proofing times. Much easier is plastic wrap, which doesn't prevent the dough from rising if you use it to cover a sufficiently large bowl. Tightly wrapping the dough itself obviously won't work. My prefered method for these very long raises is a large food-safe plastic container with a lid. It doesn't have to be super-airtight and as I usually do a round of &quot;stretch and fold&quot; or quick punchdown every 12-24 hours I never had a problem with dried or overflowing dough.  </RelAText>

        <RelAText>If you need a larger basket to fry the amount of food you want to cook, you need more oil as well. If you don't always want to make that much food (or use that much oil) then you need a smaller vessel for deep-frying, such as a second fryer or a small wok or kadai.  If you put less oil in than the minimum it may not cover the food and/or the oil could overheat, depending on how the fryer manages its temperature settings. Overheating oil can be dangerous and will also burn your food while leaving it raw inside. All around, something to avoid.  You can save and reuse frying oil. There are some good tips at the sites below. Let it cool fully then filter out food particles (I use coffee filters and a funnel for this; it can be a slow drain, be patient) Refrigerate used oil to retard bacterial growth  Stop using it if it looks weird or smells funny! http://www.seriouseats.com/2013/09/ask-the-food-lab-how-many-times-can-i-reuse-fry-oil.html http://extension.psu.edu/food/preservation/faq/questions-and-answers-about-re-using-frying-oil http://www.epicurious.com/expert-advice/you-can-reuse-frying-oil-article </RelAText>

        <RelAText>I'd dare say a small amount of oil can work if there is ample,controlled resupply of heat - why would it make much difference if it is coming from the vessel wall or more oil. However, I found that deep friers are just not designed for that, relying on the oil fill as thermal mass a lot... even or especially the small &quot;fondue&quot; style ones*. TL;DR for the rest of post: Advice on deep frying without using a fryer. Use at your own risk. You are better off with a chip pan/wok/pot and a thermometer for the kind of job where you just want to oil-blanch an ingredient and/or want to minimise oil usage because you do not want to reuse it (eg you want to fry tofu in fresh oil because it tends to be a magnet for the worst flavors it can get from old oil, you want to deep fry something with a strongly spiced and/or unruly rub/breading/batter on it, you want to fry ingredients like carrots or red bell pepper that will discolor the oil, you want to heat the oil very high initially to account for a temperature drop). The largest plate on even a normal electric hob is around 2000W - same as a medium sized home deep fryer, and pots and pans are optimized to transfer these 2000W to what is in them.  If you are not confident with open deep frying, have someone who is work with you for a while - yes it is hazardous, but manageably so - never leave the setup unattended. especially if no food in oil, monitor thermometer closely. always have something made of metal (nothing else) in reach that can cover the pot. always assume something can boil over. keep clutter away from your work area. use really high-heat oil - peanut, refined safflower, soy, rice bran; not some unspecified compound oil with a 180°C warning. be especially careful with induction, can heat a pot with small amounts of liquid in them alarmingly quick. keep the lid off as long as you are heating. if working on gas, ask someone who has experience in doing so for additional advice (overboiling into the burner is an obvious danger!), i'm electric... *the small ones that are partially plastic in construction - never managed to set a grease fire, but I think I would be far more at a loss to control one with these things than in a pot... </RelAText>

        <RelAText>I've used two different home-kitchen deep fryers over the last 18 years or so; one of them was essentially a kettle with a hidden heating element, and the other has a removable heating element that sits under the frying basket. The early one I used, the type with the hidden heating element, really has no minimum other than the basic rule-of-thumb that want at least 3x-4x the volume of oil to food being cooked, so that the oil doesn't cool down too quickly. The basket was the other factor, but if I remember correctly, my basket got pretty close to the bottom of the pan, so that wasn't a major consideration. A more serious model that I now use, which has a feature for filtering/draining oil, a more convincing thermostat, and electronic timers, has some more serious constraints, notably a minimum oil content of about 2.5 liters, and a maximum of maybe a tad over three liters. The minimum is pretty simple to explain: If you use less than 2.5 liters, none of the food will have enough room to float above the basket. You probably won't even cover the heating element without at least a liter of oil in there. Not covering the heating element has some serious consequences, namely the risk of the element glowing and eventually over-heating (based on the thermostat probe placement), oil spatter, and the more practical one of not being able to use the basket. The maximum fill line is an approximation designed to reduce the risk of oil boil-over. Having dealt with a oil boil-over on a friteuse meant for stovetop use in my starving student days in Germany, I can tell you the consequences are unpleasant. I had scars to prove it. High water content in some foods leads to furious bubbling, and if those bubbles manage to carry oil over the side of the pan, bad things happen. </RelAText>

          <RelACText>That was my thought, too -- I've seen way too many fryers where the basket stays an inch or two above the bottom, so a good deal of the oil is more heat-sync than actually coming into contact w/ the food.</RelACText>

        <RelAText>The whole point of deep frying is to use large amounts of oil. You don't want to just coat the food. You really need to have the food swim in a mass of oil much larger than the mass of the food. Else the food will cool down the oil locally and you won't get the desired crust.  So no, as long as you are using a large basket (which holds a large amount of food), you can't do proper deep frying with a small amount of oil. A consumer style deep fryer is probably already on the low side of the correct oil/food ratio.  </RelAText>

        <RelQBody>I have a favorite tried  true recipe that I simply call ‘foil potatoes’.  recipe link: http://www.evernote.com/shard/s1/sh/048c56cc-1481-48b2-89e6-88e897da651a/b0c036a6448b07e0a486f77acf2111cb This has been made multiple times with consistently good results. A few weeks ago I decided to try substituting the same quantity of home-made  greek-style yogurt in place of the whipping cream. They did not tenderize at all and although being fully cooked, were ‘crunchy’ and not desireable. As an experiment yesterday, I did another batch with part of it done with the original recipe using whipping cream,,  the rest with yogurt. All packets were done on the same grill side-by side with exactly the same time  temp. The packets with whipping cream were done perfectly  again the ones with yogurt were tough. My internet searches have not found any answers as to why this happened. In addition to wanting to understand the science of this difference, can anyone suggest changes I can make to have this substitution work? </RelQBody>

        <RelCText>Without seeing the recipe (permissions issue - it is not a public doc) it is hard to know if something else is going on, but at a minimum, the water content in cream is significantly higher than in Greek-style (strained) yogurt. I suspect that a non-strained yogurt would probably have a similar result to your cream version. You can also &quot;reconstitute&quot; strained yogurt by mixing water or milk in to give it a thinner texture which would also probably work. I doubt it is a chemical reaction, but the recipe would help.</RelCText>

        <RelAText>The amount of grease the meat exudes is dependent upon the amount of fat in the beef. If your beef is lean (10% fat), you will not likely notice a difference in the greasiness in the final product by not straining. If your meat is fatty (ground beef in the US can contain up to 30% fat), then the final product will have noticeable grease. The fat contributes in a good way (IMO) to the flavor and mouth-feel of chili if the meat is in the 15% range.  </RelAText>

        <RelCText>Have to suspect something about your cooking practices contributes to any issues you are having with PTFE. I did finally replace my 20 year old frying pan with a new one a few years back (as much for the new, thicker aluminum part as for a new cooking surface.) I don't use the PTFE for high-heat applications it's unsuited to, and I use non-metallic utensils appropriate for not scratching up the surface. OTOH, the iron skillet I went off to college with is still going strong, but I use them for different things...</RelCText>

        <RelCText>Possibly, I have changed a few things over time. When I brown meat for the slow cooker, I now use cast iron. I've warped a few aluminum non sticks doing this because I add water to the pan to get the browning out to add to the roast. Other than that it seems that most frying pans just wont stay flat and tend to shed their coatings withing 5 or 6 years.</RelCText>

        <RelAText>I find that the chemical and mechanical reactions between egg-white, egg-yolk and sugar is quite an delicate and complex one. I find that there is even a difference in using white refined cane sugar and white refined beet sugars when baking and the amount of effort of creaming eggs and sugar. Sugar substitutes that claim that they &quot;behave&quot; the same as sugar also don't seem to react in a manner that you'd expect. I would suggest that you try a range of sugars... The worse of them seems to be corn based sugars. The eggs just don't behave at all... </RelAText>

        <RelQSubject>Flavor in avocadoes gone forever?</RelQSubject>
        <RelQBody>I got some made-in-store supermarket guacamole yesterday and it was a new low in bland, watery, flavorless avocado meat. I have read that the reason modern avocadoes taste bland is because they use a variety called a &quot;Hass&quot; avocado that growers prefer because it is resistant to some kinds of blight and it does not spoil as readily as other varieties. Nevertheless, as someone who remembers as a boy getting avocadoes that tasted like, well, avocadoes and actually having good guacamole, it is really discouraging the world takeover of this tasteless drone avocado called the Hass. Also, it seems the Hass itself seems to be getting more bland and more watery year by year. Is there any way to get good avocado varieties of the old type that actually taste good, or have they gone the way of the Dodo? (I should mention that I grew up in San Diego, but now live in Massachusetts so this might be part of the problem; good avocadoes might only be available locally in Southern California.) Update By some further research I have found that apparently large numbers of avocadoes are being exported by Peru, and even though they are Hass avocadoes they are reputedly MUCH more bland than California avocadoes, but also much cheaper. So, this might be the problem, I am getting Peruvian avocadoes. </RelQBody>

        <RelAText>You're exactly right in figuring out that part of the problem is having grown up with some of the world's best avocadoes, and then moving up North where decent avocadoes are scarce!  :)  Tasty avocadoes aren't all going the way of the dodo just yet, but you might have to move to Texas or Florida, or check some Mexican markets in your area, to get better avocadoes.  My husband lived in S Calif. as a child. He is an avocado connoisseur like you, as a result. Some of the best S Cali avocadoes are 'Fuerte' variety, which is more flavorful and creamier than Hass. We live in Texas and we get some very good, tasty Mexican avocadoes here- which by the way, are Hass.  But every single avocado I've brought home to hubby, whether from Mexico, Chile, Florida, Arizona, the Caribbean, Hawaii, Guatemala or Peru, ends up being compared unfavorably to those great S Calif. avocados he remembers. We visited a relative in the S Calif. area about 4.5 years ago and hubby had a delicious, fresh S Cali 'Fuerte' variety avocado during that trip--an avocado which he still recalls most fondly.  Personally I tried that same S Cali 'Fuerte' avocado too on that trip and while it was a bit tastier than the Hass avocadoes we currently get in Texas, I didn't find the flavor all THAT much better!  But hubby did prefer it a lot; he likes what he was raised on. Also his palate is more sensitive to bitterness than mine and 'Fuerte' is less bitter than Hass. In recent years, Calif. drought has made the delicious Cali avocadoes, especially the 'Fuerte', nearly impossible to get.  By the way- I lived in Illinois for a while. That state has the same avocado problem as Massachusetts: too far away from where good avocadoes and other tropical fruits are grown, to get avocadoes with decent quality. Whatever does survive the shipping journey that far North is usually picked much too green. Around the holidays such as Christmas and 16 de Septiembre and 5 de Mayo etc., there was ONE Mexican food store in Chicago that got some fresh, air-flown ripe Mexican avocadoes for sale just for these special days..at $5 each!   Mom who was raised in Texas was desperate for a good avocado because they are almost nonexistent in Chicago, so she bought 2 of those $5 avocados for Christmas dinner and said it was worth it. I had a small taste in my salad, it was great but geez $5 a piece LOL! I'm real glad we left Chicago and moved to Texas soon after that! I wouldn't count on S. California's avocado crop doing well anytime in the near future, as that area is likely to only have worse and worse water shortages and drought problems as time goes forward.  So perhaps, sadly, the 'Fuerte' avocadoes and the other delicious S Cali avocadoes you were raised on are going the way of the dodo. I hope not because they are very good avocadoes and it's always nice to be able to get USA grown tropical fruits. But unless some amazing advances in water and climate management are made to save the Cali avocado farms from extinction, your delicious S Cali grown avocadoes may become nothing more than a fond memory. </RelAText>

        <RelAText>If you have room to place the Wellingtons on the same shelf, you simply cook them in the same way as you would a single one. Conventional ovens do not work like microwaves - the amount of stuff in the oven makes no difference, providing air flow is maintained and you don't have something large right up at the top or bottom blocking an element. Fan ovens are especially useful as they actively circulate the heat around the oven cavity, so you can cook things on two different levels with fairly good consistency. </RelAText>

        <RelAText>I recon it has formed like a cake after cooling. The best option you have is to take a big chunk of it in a microwaveable container (making sure that you are not breaking the rice grains) and sprinkling with some water. Then cover with a cling film and microwave for 3-4 minutes from cold. Your rice grains will separate because of the extra moisture from the sprinkled water and the Pulao will become slightly moist.   But yes, Pulao is a dry dish and needs to be eaten with a side like Raita or Salan. </RelAText>

        <RelAText>Pulao is usually a &quot;dry&quot; dish without any gravy/sauce left in it when it finishes cooking. If the rice seems to be fully cooked and the individual grains do not seem to be under cooked or slightly crunchy then I think it is probably correct.  Many people serve raita (I like a simple yoghurt-onion-tomato mix with some chili powder and salt) and green coriander chutney along with pulao or biryani which helps to make the overall experience less dry. I usually cook the marinade as well to make a gravy/salan to serve on the side when I make chicken biryani. </RelAText>

        <RelAText>Unless contaminated by, say, drinking straight out of the bottle, it will likely be safe to consume, but it will probably have deteriorated in quality. Sake which is no longer appealing to drink may be suitable for use in cooking; if you're not accustomed to cooking with sake, consider something simple, like potatoes simmered with a modest amount of water, sake, salt  pepper, soy sauce and butter. Low-alcohol beverages, whether fermented or slightly fortified, tend to deteriorate in quality over time, although they will become stale less slowly if their containers are sealed airtight and chilled. Port, marsala, sherry, vermouth, wine and sake all typically best consumed within a short time after opening, although the specific chemistry may vary. Some folks consider a sake that's been open, unrefrigerated, for more than a few weeks undrinkable. I don't know if I'm that rigid, but it's a good benchmark. I've seen certain sakes do ok for a few months in the refrigerator. </RelAText>

        <RelAText>It will keep until it doesn't. Eventually it will spoil, but because sake is considerably above the magic number for alcohol concentration to be self preserving when sealed (&gt;12.3% alcohol by volume), so long as you don't let any alcohol tolerant microbes into the bottle, then it will be fine. Smell it first,'if it smells earthy, throw it out, if it smells vinegary, you can use it but it's not rally sake anymore, it's rice wine vinegar. If you want, and if it's say half full, water it down and add a touch of cider vinegar to it. Cider vinegar isn't pasteurized so it will have live acetobacters in it and you can make your own vinegar. You need to cut the sake to half strength though otherwise it's too strong for the acetobacter to grow. </RelAText>

        <RelAText>Commercial pizza places usually use plastic dough proofing trays. They interlock and provide a relatively air-tight seal when they stack on top of each other. If you're looking for something that fits in your refrigerator, you should look into Artisan DoughMate trays. They are are 1/2 of the size of standard restaurant sized trays and you can fit a couple in your home fridge (Just under 18&quot; x 14&quot;) They stack with a very good air-tight seal and you just need a lid for the top one. You should be able to fit about six dough balls to a tray. If your only talking 2-3 dough balls then one tray would work, with a lid. But you also can look at aluminum dough pans. Some of these are also stackable with lids, and you put one dough ball into each one. I've often seen people spray the pans with oil so that the dough releases easily, or spray the dough balls so that if they spread into each other while proofing that don't make one massive dough ball. </RelAText>

        <RelAText>Try coating the dough ball with a little olive oil or a non-stick spray.  I don't know if that's the reason why but it's what I always do when baking bread and I never have a crust form during the rise. </RelAText>

        <RelAText>If you insist on using a damp cloth, you have to make it wet again and again, so this is quite cumbersome especially with long proofing times. Much easier is plastic wrap, which doesn't prevent the dough from rising if you use it to cover a sufficiently large bowl. Tightly wrapping the dough itself obviously won't work. My prefered method for these very long raises is a large food-safe plastic container with a lid. It doesn't have to be super-airtight and as I usually do a round of &quot;stretch and fold&quot; or quick punchdown every 12-24 hours I never had a problem with dried or overflowing dough.  </RelAText>

    <OrgQSubject>Can I double cook apple? When making, say, Apple Crumble?</OrgQSubject>
    <OrgQBody>I am new to cooking. I like to cook in batch because I want to come down to kitchen and pop something in microwave and return to my desk.   I only like apples (Granny Smith) cooked, so I steam them, i.e. wet cook them about a pack of 8 with a cup of water after I have peeled, cored and sliced them.   Then later, when I want a pudding I heat them up in microwave with some brandy butter. In order to expand my range, I think I'll try cooking some Apple Crumble.  Recipes say put the crumble mix on top of raw apple. Can I put crumble mix on top of already cooked apple?  Or will double cooking apple turn it to mush? </OrgQBody>

        <RelCText>If the company that puts out the fryer specifically says that 2.5 liters is required... is there a reason you think less would be OK? At the very least, we will need to know the brand and model of the one you have.

        <RelAText>If you need a larger basket to fry the amount of food you want to cook, you need more oil as well. If you don't always want to make that much food (or use that much oil) then you need a smaller vessel for deep-frying, such as a second fryer or a small wok or kadai.  If you put less oil in than the minimum it may not cover the food and/or the oil could overheat, depending on how the fryer manages its temperature settings. Overheating oil can be dangerous and will also burn your food while leaving it raw inside. All around, something to avoid.  You can save and reuse frying oil. There are some good tips at the sites below. Let it cool fully then filter out food particles (I use coffee filters and a funnel for this; it can be a slow drain, be patient) Refrigerate used oil to retard bacterial growth  Stop using it if it looks weird or smells funny! http://www.seriouseats.com/2013/09/ask-the-food-lab-how-many-times-can-i-reuse-fry-oil.html http://extension.psu.edu/food/preservation/faq/questions-and-answers-about-re-using-frying-oil http://www.epicurious.com/expert-advice/you-can-reuse-frying-oil-article </RelAText>

        <RelAText>I'd dare say a small amount of oil can work if there is ample,controlled resupply of heat - why would it make much difference if it is coming from the vessel wall or more oil. However, I found that deep friers are just not designed for that, relying on the oil fill as thermal mass a lot... even or especially the small &quot;fondue&quot; style ones*. TL;DR for the rest of post: Advice on deep frying without using a fryer. Use at your own risk. You are better off with a chip pan/wok/pot and a thermometer for the kind of job where you just want to oil-blanch an ingredient and/or want to minimise oil usage because you do not want to reuse it (eg you want to fry tofu in fresh oil because it tends to be a magnet for the worst flavors it can get from old oil, you want to deep fry something with a strongly spiced and/or unruly rub/breading/batter on it, you want to fry ingredients like carrots or red bell pepper that will discolor the oil, you want to heat the oil very high initially to account for a temperature drop). The largest plate on even a normal electric hob is around 2000W - same as a medium sized home deep fryer, and pots and pans are optimized to transfer these 2000W to what is in them.  If you are not confident with open deep frying, have someone who is work with you for a while - yes it is hazardous, but manageably so - never leave the setup unattended. especially if no food in oil, monitor thermometer closely. always have something made of metal (nothing else) in reach that can cover the pot. always assume something can boil over. keep clutter away from your work area. use really high-heat oil - peanut, refined safflower, soy, rice bran; not some unspecified compound oil with a 180°C warning. be especially careful with induction, can heat a pot with small amounts of liquid in them alarmingly quick. keep the lid off as long as you are heating. if working on gas, ask someone who has experience in doing so for additional advice (overboiling into the burner is an obvious danger!), i'm electric... *the small ones that are partially plastic in construction - never managed to set a grease fire, but I think I would be far more at a loss to control one with these things than in a pot... </RelAText>

        <RelAText>I've used two different home-kitchen deep fryers over the last 18 years or so; one of them was essentially a kettle with a hidden heating element, and the other has a removable heating element that sits under the frying basket. The early one I used, the type with the hidden heating element, really has no minimum other than the basic rule-of-thumb that want at least 3x-4x the volume of oil to food being cooked, so that the oil doesn't cool down too quickly. The basket was the other factor, but if I remember correctly, my basket got pretty close to the bottom of the pan, so that wasn't a major consideration. A more serious model that I now use, which has a feature for filtering/draining oil, a more convincing thermostat, and electronic timers, has some more serious constraints, notably a minimum oil content of about 2.5 liters, and a maximum of maybe a tad over three liters. The minimum is pretty simple to explain: If you use less than 2.5 liters, none of the food will have enough room to float above the basket. You probably won't even cover the heating element without at least a liter of oil in there. Not covering the heating element has some serious consequences, namely the risk of the element glowing and eventually over-heating (based on the thermostat probe placement), oil spatter, and the more practical one of not being able to use the basket. The maximum fill line is an approximation designed to reduce the risk of oil boil-over. Having dealt with a oil boil-over on a friteuse meant for stovetop use in my starving student days in Germany, I can tell you the consequences are unpleasant. I had scars to prove it. High water content in some foods leads to furious bubbling, and if those bubbles manage to carry oil over the side of the pan, bad things happen. </RelAText>

          <RelACText>That was my thought, too -- I've seen way too many fryers where the basket stays an inch or two above the bottom, so a good deal of the oil is more heat-sync than actually coming into contact w/ the food.</RelACText>

        <RelAText>The whole point of deep frying is to use large amounts of oil. You don't want to just coat the food. You really need to have the food swim in a mass of oil much larger than the mass of the food. Else the food will cool down the oil locally and you won't get the desired crust.  So no, as long as you are using a large basket (which holds a large amount of food), you can't do proper deep frying with a small amount of oil. A consumer style deep fryer is probably already on the low side of the correct oil/food ratio.  </RelAText>

A few weeks ago I decided to try substituting the same quantity of home-made  greek-style yogurt in place of the whipping cream. They did not tenderize at all and although being fully cooked, were ‘crunchy’ and not desireable. As an experiment yesterday, I did another batch with part of it done with the original recipe using whipping cream,,  the rest with yogurt. All packets were done on the same grill side-by side with exactly the same time  temp. The packets with whipping cream were done perfectly  again the ones with yogurt were tough. My internet searches have not found any answers as to why this happened. In addition to wanting to understand the science of this difference, can anyone suggest changes I can make to have this substitution work? </RelQBody>

        <RelCText>Without seeing the recipe (permissions issue - it is not a public doc) it is hard to know if something else is going on, but at a minimum, the water content in cream is significantly higher than in Greek-style (strained) yogurt. I suspect that a non-strained yogurt would probably have a similar result to your cream version. You can also &quot;reconstitute&quot; strained yogurt by mixing water or milk in to give it a thinner texture which would also probably work. I doubt it is a chemical reaction, but the recipe would help.</RelCText>

        <RelAText>The amount of grease the meat exudes is dependent upon the amount of fat in the beef. If your beef is lean (10% fat), you will not likely notice a difference in the greasiness in the final product by not straining. If your meat is fatty (ground beef in the US can contain up to 30% fat), then the final product will have noticeable grease. The fat contributes in a good way (IMO) to the flavor and mouth-feel of chili if the meat is in the 15% range.  </RelAText>

        <RelCText>Have to suspect something about your cooking practices contributes to any issues you are having with PTFE. I did finally replace my 20 year old frying pan with a new one a few years back (as much for the new, thicker aluminum part as for a new cooking surface.) I don't use the PTFE for high-heat applications it's unsuited to, and I use non-metallic utensils appropriate for not scratching up the surface. OTOH, the iron skillet I went off to college with is still going strong, but I use them for different things...</RelCText>

        <RelCText>Possibly, I have changed a few things over time. When I brown meat for the slow cooker, I now use cast iron. I've warped a few aluminum non sticks doing this because I add water to the pan to get the browning out to add to the roast. Other than that it seems that most frying pans just wont stay flat and tend to shed their coatings withing 5 or 6 years.</RelCText>

    <OrgQBody>I am new to cooking. I like to cook in batch because I want to come down to kitchen and pop something in microwave and return to my desk.   I only like apples (Granny Smith) cooked, so I steam them, i.e. wet cook them about a pack of 8 with a cup of water after I have peeled, cored and sliced them.   Then later, when I want a pudding I heat them up in microwave with some brandy butter. In order to expand my range, I think I'll try cooking some Apple Crumble.  Recipes say put the crumble mix on top of raw apple. Can I put crumble mix on top of already cooked apple?  Or will double cooking apple turn it to mush? </OrgQBody>

        <RelAText>Use maple sugar.  Things will taste better*, but cost more. *unless, of course, you are a person who does not like real maple (of whom there are a surprising number, though I cannot claim to understand that.) For ice cream/sorbet/gelato/frozen desserts, most &quot;sugar substitutes&quot; (low calorie sweeteners, etc) don't really work, as sugar plays an important structural role in how ice cream turns out. Being sugar, maple sugar (or other &quot;unrefined/less refined&quot; sugars) work fine. </RelAText>

        <RelAText>I find that the chemical and mechanical reactions between egg-white, egg-yolk and sugar is quite an delicate and complex one. I find that there is even a difference in using white refined cane sugar and white refined beet sugars when baking and the amount of effort of creaming eggs and sugar. Sugar substitutes that claim that they &quot;behave&quot; the same as sugar also don't seem to react in a manner that you'd expect. I would suggest that you try a range of sugars... The worse of them seems to be corn based sugars. The eggs just don't behave at all... </RelAText>

        <RelQSubject>Flavor in avocadoes gone forever?</RelQSubject>
        <RelQBody>I got some made-in-store supermarket guacamole yesterday and it was a new low in bland, watery, flavorless avocado meat. I have read that the reason modern avocadoes taste bland is because they use a variety called a &quot;Hass&quot; avocado that growers prefer because it is resistant to some kinds of blight and it does not spoil as readily as other varieties. Nevertheless, as someone who remembers as a boy getting avocadoes that tasted like, well, avocadoes and actually having good guacamole, it is really discouraging the world takeover of this tasteless drone avocado called the Hass. Also, it seems the Hass itself seems to be getting more bland and more watery year by year. Is there any way to get good avocado varieties of the old type that actually taste good, or have they gone the way of the Dodo? (I should mention that I grew up in San Diego, but now live in Massachusetts so this might be part of the problem; good avocadoes might only be available locally in Southern California.) Update By some further research I have found that apparently large numbers of avocadoes are being exported by Peru, and even though they are Hass avocadoes they are reputedly MUCH more bland than California avocadoes, but also much cheaper. So, this might be the problem, I am getting Peruvian avocadoes. </RelQBody>

        <RelCText>CA is in the midst of a drought. Haven't seen a good avocado from there all year.

        <RelCText>Good tropical fruit in Massachusetts is a rarity on all fronts. Picked underripe and shipped long distances does not ever compare well with picked at/near ripe from the farm up the road. Sometimes we see halfway decent Mexican or Florida avocados. Halfway decent is about as good as it gets.</RelCText>

        <RelAText>You're exactly right in figuring out that part of the problem is having grown up with some of the world's best avocadoes, and then moving up North where decent avocadoes are scarce!  :)  Tasty avocadoes aren't all going the way of the dodo just yet, but you might have to move to Texas or Florida, or check some Mexican markets in your area, to get better avocadoes.  My husband lived in S Calif. as a child. He is an avocado connoisseur like you, as a result. Some of the best S Cali avocadoes are 'Fuerte' variety, which is more flavorful and creamier than Hass. We live in Texas and we get some very good, tasty Mexican avocadoes here- which by the way, are Hass.  But every single avocado I've brought home to hubby, whether from Mexico, Chile, Florida, Arizona, the Caribbean, Hawaii, Guatemala or Peru, ends up being compared unfavorably to those great S Calif. avocados he remembers. We visited a relative in the S Calif. area about 4.5 years ago and hubby had a delicious, fresh S Cali 'Fuerte' variety avocado during that trip--an avocado which he still recalls most fondly.  Personally I tried that same S Cali 'Fuerte' avocado too on that trip and while it was a bit tastier than the Hass avocadoes we currently get in Texas, I didn't find the flavor all THAT much better!  But hubby did prefer it a lot; he likes what he was raised on. Also his palate is more sensitive to bitterness than mine and 'Fuerte' is less bitter than Hass. In recent years, Calif. drought has made the delicious Cali avocadoes, especially the 'Fuerte', nearly impossible to get.  By the way- I lived in Illinois for a while. That state has the same avocado problem as Massachusetts: too far away from where good avocadoes and other tropical fruits are grown, to get avocadoes with decent quality. Whatever does survive the shipping journey that far North is usually picked much too green. Around the holidays such as Christmas and 16 de Septiembre and 5 de Mayo etc., there was ONE Mexican food store in Chicago that got some fresh, air-flown ripe Mexican avocadoes for sale just for these special days..at $5 each!   Mom who was raised in Texas was desperate for a good avocado because they are almost nonexistent in Chicago, so she bought 2 of those $5 avocados for Christmas dinner and said it was worth it. I had a small taste in my salad, it was great but geez $5 a piece LOL! I'm real glad we left Chicago and moved to Texas soon after that! I wouldn't count on S. California's avocado crop doing well anytime in the near future, as that area is likely to only have worse and worse water shortages and drought problems as time goes forward.  So perhaps, sadly, the 'Fuerte' avocadoes and the other delicious S Cali avocadoes you were raised on are going the way of the dodo. I hope not because they are very good avocadoes and it's always nice to be able to get USA grown tropical fruits. But unless some amazing advances in water and climate management are made to save the Cali avocado farms from extinction, your delicious S Cali grown avocadoes may become nothing more than a fond memory. </RelAText>

        <RelAText>If you have room to place the Wellingtons on the same shelf, you simply cook them in the same way as you would a single one. Conventional ovens do not work like microwaves - the amount of stuff in the oven makes no difference, providing air flow is maintained and you don't have something large right up at the top or bottom blocking an element. Fan ovens are especially useful as they actively circulate the heat around the oven cavity, so you can cook things on two different levels with fairly good consistency. </RelAText>

        <RelAText>I recon it has formed like a cake after cooling. The best option you have is to take a big chunk of it in a microwaveable container (making sure that you are not breaking the rice grains) and sprinkling with some water. Then cover with a cling film and microwave for 3-4 minutes from cold. Your rice grains will separate because of the extra moisture from the sprinkled water and the Pulao will become slightly moist.   But yes, Pulao is a dry dish and needs to be eaten with a side like Raita or Salan. </RelAText>

        <RelAText>Pulao is usually a &quot;dry&quot; dish without any gravy/sauce left in it when it finishes cooking. If the rice seems to be fully cooked and the individual grains do not seem to be under cooked or slightly crunchy then I think it is probably correct.  Many people serve raita (I like a simple yoghurt-onion-tomato mix with some chili powder and salt) and green coriander chutney along with pulao or biryani which helps to make the overall experience less dry. I usually cook the marinade as well to make a gravy/salan to serve on the side when I make chicken biryani. </RelAText>

        <RelAText>Unless contaminated by, say, drinking straight out of the bottle, it will likely be safe to consume, but it will probably have deteriorated in quality. Sake which is no longer appealing to drink may be suitable for use in cooking; if you're not accustomed to cooking with sake, consider something simple, like potatoes simmered with a modest amount of water, sake, salt  pepper, soy sauce and butter. Low-alcohol beverages, whether fermented or slightly fortified, tend to deteriorate in quality over time, although they will become stale less slowly if their containers are sealed airtight and chilled. Port, marsala, sherry, vermouth, wine and sake all typically best consumed within a short time after opening, although the specific chemistry may vary. Some folks consider a sake that's been open, unrefrigerated, for more than a few weeks undrinkable. I don't know if I'm that rigid, but it's a good benchmark. I've seen certain sakes do ok for a few months in the refrigerator. </RelAText>

        <RelAText>It will keep until it doesn't. Eventually it will spoil, but because sake is considerably above the magic number for alcohol concentration to be self preserving when sealed (&gt;12.3% alcohol by volume), so long as you don't let any alcohol tolerant microbes into the bottle, then it will be fine. Smell it first,'if it smells earthy, throw it out, if it smells vinegary, you can use it but it's not rally sake anymore, it's rice wine vinegar. If you want, and if it's say half full, water it down and add a touch of cider vinegar to it. Cider vinegar isn't pasteurized so it will have live acetobacters in it and you can make your own vinegar. You need to cut the sake to half strength though otherwise it's too strong for the acetobacter to grow. </RelAText>

        <RelQBody>While proofing, the crust can appear on the dough balls if in contact with air (oxygen). I tried preventing by damp cloth but it still happens. The only thing that works 100% is plastic foil wrap, but that would prevent the dough from rising. I'd like to proof for long time this time, so it is even more important to get that technique right.  </RelQBody>

        <RelAText>Commercial pizza places usually use plastic dough proofing trays. They interlock and provide a relatively air-tight seal when they stack on top of each other. If you're looking for something that fits in your refrigerator, you should look into Artisan DoughMate trays. They are are 1/2 of the size of standard restaurant sized trays and you can fit a couple in your home fridge (Just under 18&quot; x 14&quot;) They stack with a very good air-tight seal and you just need a lid for the top one. You should be able to fit about six dough balls to a tray. If your only talking 2-3 dough balls then one tray would work, with a lid. But you also can look at aluminum dough pans. Some of these are also stackable with lids, and you put one dough ball into each one. I've often seen people spray the pans with oil so that the dough releases easily, or spray the dough balls so that if they spread into each other while proofing that don't make one massive dough ball. </RelAText>

        <RelAText>Try coating the dough ball with a little olive oil or a non-stick spray.  I don't know if that's the reason why but it's what I always do when baking bread and I never have a crust form during the rise. </RelAText>

        <RelAText>If you insist on using a damp cloth, you have to make it wet again and again, so this is quite cumbersome especially with long proofing times. Much easier is plastic wrap, which doesn't prevent the dough from rising if you use it to cover a sufficiently large bowl. Tightly wrapping the dough itself obviously won't work. My prefered method for these very long raises is a large food-safe plastic container with a lid. It doesn't have to be super-airtight and as I usually do a round of &quot;stretch and fold&quot; or quick punchdown every 12-24 hours I never had a problem with dried or overflowing dough.  </RelAText>

        <RelCText>If the company that puts out the fryer specifically says that 2.5 liters is required... is there a reason you think less would be OK? At the very least, we will need to know the brand and model of the one you have.

        <RelAText>If you need a larger basket to fry the amount of food you want to cook, you need more oil as well. If you don't always want to make that much food (or use that much oil) then you need a smaller vessel for deep-frying, such as a second fryer or a small wok or kadai.  If you put less oil in than the minimum it may not cover the food and/or the oil could overheat, depending on how the fryer manages its temperature settings. Overheating oil can be dangerous and will also burn your food while leaving it raw inside. All around, something to avoid.  You can save and reuse frying oil. There are some good tips at the sites below. Let it cool fully then filter out food particles (I use coffee filters and a funnel for this; it can be a slow drain, be patient) Refrigerate used oil to retard bacterial growth  Stop using it if it looks weird or smells funny! http://www.seriouseats.com/2013/09/ask-the-food-lab-how-many-times-can-i-reuse-fry-oil.html http://extension.psu.edu/food/preservation/faq/questions-and-answers-about-re-using-frying-oil http://www.epicurious.com/expert-advice/you-can-reuse-frying-oil-article </RelAText>

        <RelAText>I'd dare say a small amount of oil can work if there is ample,controlled resupply of heat - why would it make much difference if it is coming from the vessel wall or more oil. However, I found that deep friers are just not designed for that, relying on the oil fill as thermal mass a lot... even or especially the small &quot;fondue&quot; style ones*. TL;DR for the rest of post: Advice on deep frying without using a fryer. Use at your own risk. You are better off with a chip pan/wok/pot and a thermometer for the kind of job where you just want to oil-blanch an ingredient and/or want to minimise oil usage because you do not want to reuse it (eg you want to fry tofu in fresh oil because it tends to be a magnet for the worst flavors it can get from old oil, you want to deep fry something with a strongly spiced and/or unruly rub/breading/batter on it, you want to fry ingredients like carrots or red bell pepper that will discolor the oil, you want to heat the oil very high initially to account for a temperature drop). The largest plate on even a normal electric hob is around 2000W - same as a medium sized home deep fryer, and pots and pans are optimized to transfer these 2000W to what is in them.  If you are not confident with open deep frying, have someone who is work with you for a while - yes it is hazardous, but manageably so - never leave the setup unattended. especially if no food in oil, monitor thermometer closely. always have something made of metal (nothing else) in reach that can cover the pot. always assume something can boil over. keep clutter away from your work area. use really high-heat oil - peanut, refined safflower, soy, rice bran; not some unspecified compound oil with a 180°C warning. be especially careful with induction, can heat a pot with small amounts of liquid in them alarmingly quick. keep the lid off as long as you are heating. if working on gas, ask someone who has experience in doing so for additional advice (overboiling into the burner is an obvious danger!), i'm electric... *the small ones that are partially plastic in construction - never managed to set a grease fire, but I think I would be far more at a loss to control one with these things than in a pot... </RelAText>

        <RelAText>I've used two different home-kitchen deep fryers over the last 18 years or so; one of them was essentially a kettle with a hidden heating element, and the other has a removable heating element that sits under the frying basket. The early one I used, the type with the hidden heating element, really has no minimum other than the basic rule-of-thumb that want at least 3x-4x the volume of oil to food being cooked, so that the oil doesn't cool down too quickly. The basket was the other factor, but if I remember correctly, my basket got pretty close to the bottom of the pan, so that wasn't a major consideration. A more serious model that I now use, which has a feature for filtering/draining oil, a more convincing thermostat, and electronic timers, has some more serious constraints, notably a minimum oil content of about 2.5 liters, and a maximum of maybe a tad over three liters. The minimum is pretty simple to explain: If you use less than 2.5 liters, none of the food will have enough room to float above the basket. You probably won't even cover the heating element without at least a liter of oil in there. Not covering the heating element has some serious consequences, namely the risk of the element glowing and eventually over-heating (based on the thermostat probe placement), oil spatter, and the more practical one of not being able to use the basket. The maximum fill line is an approximation designed to reduce the risk of oil boil-over. Having dealt with a oil boil-over on a friteuse meant for stovetop use in my starving student days in Germany, I can tell you the consequences are unpleasant. I had scars to prove it. High water content in some foods leads to furious bubbling, and if those bubbles manage to carry oil over the side of the pan, bad things happen. </RelAText>

          <RelACText>That was my thought, too -- I've seen way too many fryers where the basket stays an inch or two above the bottom, so a good deal of the oil is more heat-sync than actually coming into contact w/ the food.</RelACText>

        <RelAText>The whole point of deep frying is to use large amounts of oil. You don't want to just coat the food. You really need to have the food swim in a mass of oil much larger than the mass of the food. Else the food will cool down the oil locally and you won't get the desired crust.  So no, as long as you are using a large basket (which holds a large amount of food), you can't do proper deep frying with a small amount of oil. A consumer style deep fryer is probably already on the low side of the correct oil/food ratio.  </RelAText>

A few weeks ago I decided to try substituting the same quantity of home-made  greek-style yogurt in place of the whipping cream. They did not tenderize at all and although being fully cooked, were ‘crunchy’ and not desireable. As an experiment yesterday, I did another batch with part of it done with the original recipe using whipping cream,,  the rest with yogurt. All packets were done on the same grill side-by side with exactly the same time  temp. The packets with whipping cream were done perfectly  again the ones with yogurt were tough. My internet searches have not found any answers as to why this happened. In addition to wanting to understand the science of this difference, can anyone suggest changes I can make to have this substitution work? </RelQBody>

        <RelCText>Without seeing the recipe (permissions issue - it is not a public doc) it is hard to know if something else is going on, but at a minimum, the water content in cream is significantly higher than in Greek-style (strained) yogurt. I suspect that a non-strained yogurt would probably have a similar result to your cream version. You can also &quot;reconstitute&quot; strained yogurt by mixing water or milk in to give it a thinner texture which would also probably work. I doubt it is a chemical reaction, but the recipe would help.</RelCText>

        <RelAText>The amount of grease the meat exudes is dependent upon the amount of fat in the beef. If your beef is lean (10% fat), you will not likely notice a difference in the greasiness in the final product by not straining. If your meat is fatty (ground beef in the US can contain up to 30% fat), then the final product will have noticeable grease. The fat contributes in a good way (IMO) to the flavor and mouth-feel of chili if the meat is in the 15% range.  </RelAText>

        <RelQSubject>Teflon vs. Porcelain lined cookware (stove top)</RelQSubject>
        <RelQBody>We've had awful luck with non stick pots and pans no matter how much we spend on them. Most have been Teflon coated. We recently bought a bunch of &quot;high quality&quot;, expensive, porcelain lined aluminum cookwares with enamel coated exteriors. I love the nonstick, easy cleaning so far. They are about 6 months old and no issues. Just wondering what others think of Porcelain vs Teflon cookware. Hope this will last much longer than what I've been use to.  </RelQBody>

        <RelCText>Have to suspect something about your cooking practices contributes to any issues you are having with PTFE. I did finally replace my 20 year old frying pan with a new one a few years back (as much for the new, thicker aluminum part as for a new cooking surface.) I don't use the PTFE for high-heat applications it's unsuited to, and I use non-metallic utensils appropriate for not scratching up the surface. OTOH, the iron skillet I went off to college with is still going strong, but I use them for different things...</RelCText>

        <RelCText>Possibly, I have changed a few things over time. When I brown meat for the slow cooker, I now use cast iron. I've warped a few aluminum non sticks doing this because I add water to the pan to get the browning out to add to the roast. Other than that it seems that most frying pans just wont stay flat and tend to shed their coatings withing 5 or 6 years.</RelCText>

        <RelAText>I find that the chemical and mechanical reactions between egg-white, egg-yolk and sugar is quite an delicate and complex one. I find that there is even a difference in using white refined cane sugar and white refined beet sugars when baking and the amount of effort of creaming eggs and sugar. Sugar substitutes that claim that they &quot;behave&quot; the same as sugar also don't seem to react in a manner that you'd expect. I would suggest that you try a range of sugars... The worse of them seems to be corn based sugars. The eggs just don't behave at all... </RelAText>

        <RelQSubject>Flavor in avocadoes gone forever?</RelQSubject>
        <RelQBody>I got some made-in-store supermarket guacamole yesterday and it was a new low in bland, watery, flavorless avocado meat. I have read that the reason modern avocadoes taste bland is because they use a variety called a &quot;Hass&quot; avocado that growers prefer because it is resistant to some kinds of blight and it does not spoil as readily as other varieties. Nevertheless, as someone who remembers as a boy getting avocadoes that tasted like, well, avocadoes and actually having good guacamole, it is really discouraging the world takeover of this tasteless drone avocado called the Hass. Also, it seems the Hass itself seems to be getting more bland and more watery year by year. Is there any way to get good avocado varieties of the old type that actually taste good, or have they gone the way of the Dodo? (I should mention that I grew up in San Diego, but now live in Massachusetts so this might be part of the problem; good avocadoes might only be available locally in Southern California.) Update By some further research I have found that apparently large numbers of avocadoes are being exported by Peru, and even though they are Hass avocadoes they are reputedly MUCH more bland than California avocadoes, but also much cheaper. So, this might be the problem, I am getting Peruvian avocadoes. </RelQBody>

        <RelCText>Good tropical fruit in Massachusetts is a rarity on all fronts. Picked underripe and shipped long distances does not ever compare well with picked at/near ripe from the farm up the road. Sometimes we see halfway decent Mexican or Florida avocados.

        <RelAText>You're exactly right in figuring out that part of the problem is having grown up with some of the world's best avocadoes, and then moving up North where decent avocadoes are scarce!  :)  Tasty avocadoes aren't all going the way of the dodo just yet, but you might have to move to Texas or Florida, or check some Mexican markets in your area, to get better avocadoes.  My husband lived in S Calif. as a child. He is an avocado connoisseur like you, as a result. Some of the best S Cali avocadoes are 'Fuerte' variety, which is more flavorful and creamier than Hass. We live in Texas and we get some very good, tasty Mexican avocadoes here- which by the way, are Hass.  But every single avocado I've brought home to hubby, whether from Mexico, Chile, Florida, Arizona, the Caribbean, Hawaii, Guatemala or Peru, ends up being compared unfavorably to those great S Calif. avocados he remembers. We visited a relative in the S Calif. area about 4.5 years ago and hubby had a delicious, fresh S Cali 'Fuerte' variety avocado during that trip--an avocado which he still recalls most fondly.  Personally I tried that same S Cali 'Fuerte' avocado too on that trip and while it was a bit tastier than the Hass avocadoes we currently get in Texas, I didn't find the flavor all THAT much better!  But hubby did prefer it a lot; he likes what he was raised on. Also his palate is more sensitive to bitterness than mine and 'Fuerte' is less bitter than Hass. In recent years, Calif. drought has made the delicious Cali avocadoes, especially the 'Fuerte', nearly impossible to get.  By the way- I lived in Illinois for a while. That state has the same avocado problem as Massachusetts: too far away from where good avocadoes and other tropical fruits are grown, to get avocadoes with decent quality. Whatever does survive the shipping journey that far North is usually picked much too green. Around the holidays such as Christmas and 16 de Septiembre and 5 de Mayo etc., there was ONE Mexican food store in Chicago that got some fresh, air-flown ripe Mexican avocadoes for sale just for these special days..at $5 each!   Mom who was raised in Texas was desperate for a good avocado because they are almost nonexistent in Chicago, so she bought 2 of those $5 avocados for Christmas dinner and said it was worth it. I had a small taste in my salad, it was great but geez $5 a piece LOL! I'm real glad we left Chicago and moved to Texas soon after that! I wouldn't count on S. California's avocado crop doing well anytime in the near future, as that area is likely to only have worse and worse water shortages and drought problems as time goes forward.  So perhaps, sadly, the 'Fuerte' avocadoes and the other delicious S Cali avocadoes you were raised on are going the way of the dodo. I hope not because they are very good avocadoes and it's always nice to be able to get USA grown tropical fruits. But unless some amazing advances in water and climate management are made to save the Cali avocado farms from extinction, your delicious S Cali grown avocadoes may become nothing more than a fond memory. </RelAText>

        <RelAText>If you have room to place the Wellingtons on the same shelf, you simply cook them in the same way as you would a single one. Conventional ovens do not work like microwaves - the amount of stuff in the oven makes no difference, providing air flow is maintained and you don't have something large right up at the top or bottom blocking an element. Fan ovens are especially useful as they actively circulate the heat around the oven cavity, so you can cook things on two different levels with fairly good consistency. </RelAText>

        <RelAText>I recon it has formed like a cake after cooling. The best option you have is to take a big chunk of it in a microwaveable container (making sure that you are not breaking the rice grains) and sprinkling with some water. Then cover with a cling film and microwave for 3-4 minutes from cold. Your rice grains will separate because of the extra moisture from the sprinkled water and the Pulao will become slightly moist.   But yes, Pulao is a dry dish and needs to be eaten with a side like Raita or Salan. </RelAText>

        <RelAText>Pulao is usually a &quot;dry&quot; dish without any gravy/sauce left in it when it finishes cooking. If the rice seems to be fully cooked and the individual grains do not seem to be under cooked or slightly crunchy then I think it is probably correct.  Many people serve raita (I like a simple yoghurt-onion-tomato mix with some chili powder and salt) and green coriander chutney along with pulao or biryani which helps to make the overall experience less dry. I usually cook the marinade as well to make a gravy/salan to serve on the side when I make chicken biryani. </RelAText>

        <RelAText>Unless contaminated by, say, drinking straight out of the bottle, it will likely be safe to consume, but it will probably have deteriorated in quality. Sake which is no longer appealing to drink may be suitable for use in cooking; if you're not accustomed to cooking with sake, consider something simple, like potatoes simmered with a modest amount of water, sake, salt  pepper, soy sauce and butter. Low-alcohol beverages, whether fermented or slightly fortified, tend to deteriorate in quality over time, although they will become stale less slowly if their containers are sealed airtight and chilled. Port, marsala, sherry, vermouth, wine and sake all typically best consumed within a short time after opening, although the specific chemistry may vary. Some folks consider a sake that's been open, unrefrigerated, for more than a few weeks undrinkable. I don't know if I'm that rigid, but it's a good benchmark. I've seen certain sakes do ok for a few months in the refrigerator. </RelAText>

        <RelAText>It will keep until it doesn't. Eventually it will spoil, but because sake is considerably above the magic number for alcohol concentration to be self preserving when sealed (&gt;12.3% alcohol by volume), so long as you don't let any alcohol tolerant microbes into the bottle, then it will be fine. Smell it first,'if it smells earthy, throw it out, if it smells vinegary, you can use it but it's not rally sake anymore, it's rice wine vinegar. If you want, and if it's say half full, water it down and add a touch of cider vinegar to it. Cider vinegar isn't pasteurized so it will have live acetobacters in it and you can make your own vinegar. You need to cut the sake to half strength though otherwise it's too strong for the acetobacter to grow. </RelAText>

        <RelAText>Commercial pizza places usually use plastic dough proofing trays. They interlock and provide a relatively air-tight seal when they stack on top of each other. If you're looking for something that fits in your refrigerator, you should look into Artisan DoughMate trays. They are are 1/2 of the size of standard restaurant sized trays and you can fit a couple in your home fridge (Just under 18&quot; x 14&quot;) They stack with a very good air-tight seal and you just need a lid for the top one. You should be able to fit about six dough balls to a tray. If your only talking 2-3 dough balls then one tray would work, with a lid. But you also can look at aluminum dough pans. Some of these are also stackable with lids, and you put one dough ball into each one. I've often seen people spray the pans with oil so that the dough releases easily, or spray the dough balls so that if they spread into each other while proofing that don't make one massive dough ball. </RelAText>

        <RelAText>Try coating the dough ball with a little olive oil or a non-stick spray.  I don't know if that's the reason why but it's what I always do when baking bread and I never have a crust form during the rise. </RelAText>

        <RelAText>If you insist on using a damp cloth, you have to make it wet again and again, so this is quite cumbersome especially with long proofing times. Much easier is plastic wrap, which doesn't prevent the dough from rising if you use it to cover a sufficiently large bowl. Tightly wrapping the dough itself obviously won't work. My prefered method for these very long raises is a large food-safe plastic container with a lid. It doesn't have to be super-airtight and as I usually do a round of &quot;stretch and fold&quot; or quick punchdown every 12-24 hours I never had a problem with dried or overflowing dough.  </RelAText>

        <RelCText>If the company that puts out the fryer specifically says that 2.5 liters is required... is there a reason you think less would be OK?

        <RelAText>If you need a larger basket to fry the amount of food you want to cook, you need more oil as well. If you don't always want to make that much food (or use that much oil) then you need a smaller vessel for deep-frying, such as a second fryer or a small wok or kadai.  If you put less oil in than the minimum it may not cover the food and/or the oil could overheat, depending on how the fryer manages its temperature settings. Overheating oil can be dangerous and will also burn your food while leaving it raw inside. All around, something to avoid.  You can save and reuse frying oil. There are some good tips at the sites below. Let it cool fully then filter out food particles (I use coffee filters and a funnel for this; it can be a slow drain, be patient) Refrigerate used oil to retard bacterial growth  Stop using it if it looks weird or smells funny! http://www.seriouseats.com/2013/09/ask-the-food-lab-how-many-times-can-i-reuse-fry-oil.html http://extension.psu.edu/food/preservation/faq/questions-and-answers-about-re-using-frying-oil http://www.epicurious.com/expert-advice/you-can-reuse-frying-oil-article </RelAText>

        <RelAText>I'd dare say a small amount of oil can work if there is ample,controlled resupply of heat - why would it make much difference if it is coming from the vessel wall or more oil. However, I found that deep friers are just not designed for that, relying on the oil fill as thermal mass a lot... even or especially the small &quot;fondue&quot; style ones*. TL;DR for the rest of post: Advice on deep frying without using a fryer. Use at your own risk. You are better off with a chip pan/wok/pot and a thermometer for the kind of job where you just want to oil-blanch an ingredient and/or want to minimise oil usage because you do not want to reuse it (eg you want to fry tofu in fresh oil because it tends to be a magnet for the worst flavors it can get from old oil, you want to deep fry something with a strongly spiced and/or unruly rub/breading/batter on it, you want to fry ingredients like carrots or red bell pepper that will discolor the oil, you want to heat the oil very high initially to account for a temperature drop). The largest plate on even a normal electric hob is around 2000W - same as a medium sized home deep fryer, and pots and pans are optimized to transfer these 2000W to what is in them.  If you are not confident with open deep frying, have someone who is work with you for a while - yes it is hazardous, but manageably so - never leave the setup unattended. especially if no food in oil, monitor thermometer closely. always have something made of metal (nothing else) in reach that can cover the pot. always assume something can boil over. keep clutter away from your work area. use really high-heat oil - peanut, refined safflower, soy, rice bran; not some unspecified compound oil with a 180°C warning. be especially careful with induction, can heat a pot with small amounts of liquid in them alarmingly quick. keep the lid off as long as you are heating. if working on gas, ask someone who has experience in doing so for additional advice (overboiling into the burner is an obvious danger!), i'm electric... *the small ones that are partially plastic in construction - never managed to set a grease fire, but I think I would be far more at a loss to control one with these things than in a pot... </RelAText>

        <RelAText>I've used two different home-kitchen deep fryers over the last 18 years or so; one of them was essentially a kettle with a hidden heating element, and the other has a removable heating element that sits under the frying basket. The early one I used, the type with the hidden heating element, really has no minimum other than the basic rule-of-thumb that want at least 3x-4x the volume of oil to food being cooked, so that the oil doesn't cool down too quickly. The basket was the other factor, but if I remember correctly, my basket got pretty close to the bottom of the pan, so that wasn't a major consideration. A more serious model that I now use, which has a feature for filtering/draining oil, a more convincing thermostat, and electronic timers, has some more serious constraints, notably a minimum oil content of about 2.5 liters, and a maximum of maybe a tad over three liters. The minimum is pretty simple to explain: If you use less than 2.5 liters, none of the food will have enough room to float above the basket. You probably won't even cover the heating element without at least a liter of oil in there. Not covering the heating element has some serious consequences, namely the risk of the element glowing and eventually over-heating (based on the thermostat probe placement), oil spatter, and the more practical one of not being able to use the basket. The maximum fill line is an approximation designed to reduce the risk of oil boil-over. Having dealt with a oil boil-over on a friteuse meant for stovetop use in my starving student days in Germany, I can tell you the consequences are unpleasant. I had scars to prove it. High water content in some foods leads to furious bubbling, and if those bubbles manage to carry oil over the side of the pan, bad things happen. </RelAText>

          <RelACText>That was my thought, too -- I've seen way too many fryers where the basket stays an inch or two above the bottom, so a good deal of the oil is more heat-sync than actually coming into contact w/ the food.</RelACText>

        <RelAText>The whole point of deep frying is to use large amounts of oil. You don't want to just coat the food. You really need to have the food swim in a mass of oil much larger than the mass of the food. Else the food will cool down the oil locally and you won't get the desired crust.  So no, as long as you are using a large basket (which holds a large amount of food), you can't do proper deep frying with a small amount of oil. A consumer style deep fryer is probably already on the low side of the correct oil/food ratio.  </RelAText>

A few weeks ago I decided to try substituting the same quantity of home-made  greek-style yogurt in place of the whipping cream. They did not tenderize at all and although being fully cooked, were ‘crunchy’ and not desireable. As an experiment yesterday, I did another batch with part of it done with the original recipe using whipping cream,,  the rest with yogurt. All packets were done on the same grill side-by side with exactly the same time  temp. The packets with whipping cream were done perfectly  again the ones with yogurt were tough. My internet searches have not found any answers as to why this happened. In addition to wanting to understand the science of this difference, can anyone suggest changes I can make to have this substitution work? </RelQBody>

        <RelCText>Without seeing the recipe (permissions issue - it is not a public doc) it is hard to know if something else is going on, but at a minimum, the water content in cream is significantly higher than in Greek-style (strained) yogurt. I suspect that a non-strained yogurt would probably have a similar result to your cream version. You can also &quot;reconstitute&quot; strained yogurt by mixing water or milk in to give it a thinner texture which would also probably work.

        <RelAText>The amount of grease the meat exudes is dependent upon the amount of fat in the beef. If your beef is lean (10% fat), you will not likely notice a difference in the greasiness in the final product by not straining. If your meat is fatty (ground beef in the US can contain up to 30% fat), then the final product will have noticeable grease. The fat contributes in a good way (IMO) to the flavor and mouth-feel of chili if the meat is in the 15% range.  </RelAText>

        <RelCText>Have to suspect something about your cooking practices contributes to any issues you are having with PTFE. I did finally replace my 20 year old frying pan with a new one a few years back (as much for the new, thicker aluminum part as for a new cooking surface.) I don't use the PTFE for high-heat applications it's unsuited to, and I use non-metallic utensils appropriate for not scratching up the surface. OTOH, the iron skillet I went off to college with is still going strong, but I use them for different things...</RelCText>

        <RelCText>Possibly, I have changed a few things over time. When I brown meat for the slow cooker, I now use cast iron. I've warped a few aluminum non sticks doing this because I add water to the pan to get the browning out to add to the roast. Other than that it seems that most frying pans just wont stay flat and tend to shed their coatings withing 5 or 6 years.</RelCText>

For ice cream/sorbet/gelato/frozen desserts, most &quot;sugar substitutes&quot; (low calorie sweeteners, etc) don't really work, as sugar plays an important structural role in how ice cream turns out.

        <RelAText>I find that the chemical and mechanical reactions between egg-white, egg-yolk and sugar is quite an delicate and complex one. I find that there is even a difference in using white refined cane sugar and white refined beet sugars when baking and the amount of effort of creaming eggs and sugar. Sugar substitutes that claim that they &quot;behave&quot; the same as sugar also don't seem to react in a manner that you'd expect. I would suggest that you try a range of sugars... The worse of them seems to be corn based sugars. The eggs just don't behave at all... </RelAText>

        <RelQSubject>Flavor in avocadoes gone forever?</RelQSubject>
        <RelQBody>I got some made-in-store supermarket guacamole yesterday and it was a new low in bland, watery, flavorless avocado meat. I have read that the reason modern avocadoes taste bland is because they use a variety called a &quot;Hass&quot; avocado that growers prefer because it is resistant to some kinds of blight and it does not spoil as readily as other varieties. Nevertheless, as someone who remembers as a boy getting avocadoes that tasted like, well, avocadoes and actually having good guacamole, it is really discouraging the world takeover of this tasteless drone avocado called the Hass. Also, it seems the Hass itself seems to be getting more bland and more watery year by year. Is there any way to get good avocado varieties of the old type that actually taste good, or have they gone the way of the Dodo? (I should mention that I grew up in San Diego, but now live in Massachusetts so this might be part of the problem; good avocadoes might only be available locally in Southern California.) Update By some further research I have found that apparently large numbers of avocadoes are being exported by Peru, and even though they are Hass avocadoes they are reputedly MUCH more bland than California avocadoes, but also much cheaper. So, this might be the problem, I am getting Peruvian avocadoes. </RelQBody>

        <RelAText>You're exactly right in figuring out that part of the problem is having grown up with some of the world's best avocadoes, and then moving up North where decent avocadoes are scarce!  :)  Tasty avocadoes aren't all going the way of the dodo just yet, but you might have to move to Texas or Florida, or check some Mexican markets in your area, to get better avocadoes.  My husband lived in S Calif. as a child. He is an avocado connoisseur like you, as a result. Some of the best S Cali avocadoes are 'Fuerte' variety, which is more flavorful and creamier than Hass. We live in Texas and we get some very good, tasty Mexican avocadoes here- which by the way, are Hass.  But every single avocado I've brought home to hubby, whether from Mexico, Chile, Florida, Arizona, the Caribbean, Hawaii, Guatemala or Peru, ends up being compared unfavorably to those great S Calif. avocados he remembers. We visited a relative in the S Calif. area about 4.5 years ago and hubby had a delicious, fresh S Cali 'Fuerte' variety avocado during that trip--an avocado which he still recalls most fondly.  Personally I tried that same S Cali 'Fuerte' avocado too on that trip and while it was a bit tastier than the Hass avocadoes we currently get in Texas, I didn't find the flavor all THAT much better!  But hubby did prefer it a lot; he likes what he was raised on. Also his palate is more sensitive to bitterness than mine and 'Fuerte' is less bitter than Hass. In recent years, Calif. drought has made the delicious Cali avocadoes, especially the 'Fuerte', nearly impossible to get.  By the way- I lived in Illinois for a while. That state has the same avocado problem as Massachusetts: too far away from where good avocadoes and other tropical fruits are grown, to get avocadoes with decent quality. Whatever does survive the shipping journey that far North is usually picked much too green. Around the holidays such as Christmas and 16 de Septiembre and 5 de Mayo etc., there was ONE Mexican food store in Chicago that got some fresh, air-flown ripe Mexican avocadoes for sale just for these special days..at $5 each!   Mom who was raised in Texas was desperate for a good avocado because they are almost nonexistent in Chicago, so she bought 2 of those $5 avocados for Christmas dinner and said it was worth it. I had a small taste in my salad, it was great but geez $5 a piece LOL! I'm real glad we left Chicago and moved to Texas soon after that! I wouldn't count on S. California's avocado crop doing well anytime in the near future, as that area is likely to only have worse and worse water shortages and drought problems as time goes forward.  So perhaps, sadly, the 'Fuerte' avocadoes and the other delicious S Cali avocadoes you were raised on are going the way of the dodo. I hope not because they are very good avocadoes and it's always nice to be able to get USA grown tropical fruits. But unless some amazing advances in water and climate management are made to save the Cali avocado farms from extinction, your delicious S Cali grown avocadoes may become nothing more than a fond memory. </RelAText>

        <RelCText>I'm not confident enough in my thoughts to make it in answer, but I don't think it will work. The issue is that you'd need to get the new butterfat emulsified into the cream, not just drizzled in. Maybe it would work to spin the cream with an immmersion blender and drizzle the butter in, but my guess is that would just give you butter crystals.</RelCText>

        <RelAText>No, it won't work.  Michael's comment explains why. Whipping cream is not just fat and water mixed, it is fat and water emulsified. This is a big difference.  If you had some special reason to do this on a regular basis, you could get it to work by adding emulsifiers. You can beat any fat with water and lecithine or xanthan and get a creamy result. As far as I know, this is how plant based cream substitutes work.  But if the issue is that you just don't have whipping cream right now at home, then it is easier to go buy whipping cream than to go find emulsifiers (I buy mine online, don't know if there are brick-and-mortar B2C stores which sell them). If for some reason you absolutely can't do it in time, I would suggest using a different filling. Pastry cream works well with millefeulle, buttercream can work too, lightened with whipped eggwhites if necessary.  </RelAText>

        <RelAText>Yes, this is possible but you need a high-speed blender like a Thermomix or Vitamix to do so. There's actually a recipe on the Thermomix website: http://www.ukthermomix.com/recshow.php?rec_id=29   Ingredients      250 gm unsalted butter      250 gm milk (full cream or semi-skimmed)      Method      Weigh butter in pieces and milk into the Thermomix bowl.  Cook 3 minutes/ 90C/ Speed 1.  Blend 30 seconds/ Speed 8.  This emulsifies the butterfat back into the warmed milk and makes a perfectly delicious cream.  Chill in the fridge 4 hours to use as pouring or spooning cream.  Chill in the fridge 8 hours or more to be able to whip the cream. I presume you could tweak the ratio to account for the difference in fat between milk and cream to make your double cream. </RelAText>

        <RelAText>You can buy attachments for the Kenwood mixer and buy hand operated cream makers which require warmed milk and butter. I must get one because the lower fat creams available in Germany where I now live just don't work in my recipes.  You can buy cream that whipped but its very loose  </RelAText>

        <RelAText>If you have room to place the Wellingtons on the same shelf, you simply cook them in the same way as you would a single one. Conventional ovens do not work like microwaves - the amount of stuff in the oven makes no difference, providing air flow is maintained and you don't have something large right up at the top or bottom blocking an element. Fan ovens are especially useful as they actively circulate the heat around the oven cavity, so you can cook things on two different levels with fairly good consistency. </RelAText>

        <RelAText>I recon it has formed like a cake after cooling. The best option you have is to take a big chunk of it in a microwaveable container (making sure that you are not breaking the rice grains) and sprinkling with some water. Then cover with a cling film and microwave for 3-4 minutes from cold. Your rice grains will separate because of the extra moisture from the sprinkled water and the Pulao will become slightly moist.   But yes, Pulao is a dry dish and needs to be eaten with a side like Raita or Salan. </RelAText>

        <RelAText>Pulao is usually a &quot;dry&quot; dish without any gravy/sauce left in it when it finishes cooking. If the rice seems to be fully cooked and the individual grains do not seem to be under cooked or slightly crunchy then I think it is probably correct.  Many people serve raita (I like a simple yoghurt-onion-tomato mix with some chili powder and salt) and green coriander chutney along with pulao or biryani which helps to make the overall experience less dry. I usually cook the marinade as well to make a gravy/salan to serve on the side when I make chicken biryani. </RelAText>

        <RelAText>Unless contaminated by, say, drinking straight out of the bottle, it will likely be safe to consume, but it will probably have deteriorated in quality. Sake which is no longer appealing to drink may be suitable for use in cooking; if you're not accustomed to cooking with sake, consider something simple, like potatoes simmered with a modest amount of water, sake, salt  pepper, soy sauce and butter. Low-alcohol beverages, whether fermented or slightly fortified, tend to deteriorate in quality over time, although they will become stale less slowly if their containers are sealed airtight and chilled. Port, marsala, sherry, vermouth, wine and sake all typically best consumed within a short time after opening, although the specific chemistry may vary. Some folks consider a sake that's been open, unrefrigerated, for more than a few weeks undrinkable. I don't know if I'm that rigid, but it's a good benchmark. I've seen certain sakes do ok for a few months in the refrigerator. </RelAText>

        <RelAText>It will keep until it doesn't. Eventually it will spoil, but because sake is considerably above the magic number for alcohol concentration to be self preserving when sealed (&gt;12.3% alcohol by volume), so long as you don't let any alcohol tolerant microbes into the bottle, then it will be fine. Smell it first,'if it smells earthy, throw it out, if it smells vinegary, you can use it but it's not rally sake anymore, it's rice wine vinegar. If you want, and if it's say half full, water it down and add a touch of cider vinegar to it. Cider vinegar isn't pasteurized so it will have live acetobacters in it and you can make your own vinegar. You need to cut the sake to half strength though otherwise it's too strong for the acetobacter to grow. </RelAText>

        <RelAText>Commercial pizza places usually use plastic dough proofing trays. They interlock and provide a relatively air-tight seal when they stack on top of each other. If you're looking for something that fits in your refrigerator, you should look into Artisan DoughMate trays. They are are 1/2 of the size of standard restaurant sized trays and you can fit a couple in your home fridge (Just under 18&quot; x 14&quot;) They stack with a very good air-tight seal and you just need a lid for the top one. You should be able to fit about six dough balls to a tray. If your only talking 2-3 dough balls then one tray would work, with a lid. But you also can look at aluminum dough pans. Some of these are also stackable with lids, and you put one dough ball into each one. I've often seen people spray the pans with oil so that the dough releases easily, or spray the dough balls so that if they spread into each other while proofing that don't make one massive dough ball. </RelAText>

        <RelAText>Try coating the dough ball with a little olive oil or a non-stick spray.  I don't know if that's the reason why but it's what I always do when baking bread and I never have a crust form during the rise. </RelAText>

        <RelAText>If you insist on using a damp cloth, you have to make it wet again and again, so this is quite cumbersome especially with long proofing times. Much easier is plastic wrap, which doesn't prevent the dough from rising if you use it to cover a sufficiently large bowl. Tightly wrapping the dough itself obviously won't work. My prefered method for these very long raises is a large food-safe plastic container with a lid. It doesn't have to be super-airtight and as I usually do a round of &quot;stretch and fold&quot; or quick punchdown every 12-24 hours I never had a problem with dried or overflowing dough.  </RelAText>

        <RelAText>If you need a larger basket to fry the amount of food you want to cook, you need more oil as well. If you don't always want to make that much food (or use that much oil) then you need a smaller vessel for deep-frying, such as a second fryer or a small wok or kadai.  If you put less oil in than the minimum it may not cover the food and/or the oil could overheat, depending on how the fryer manages its temperature settings. Overheating oil can be dangerous and will also burn your food while leaving it raw inside. All around, something to avoid.  You can save and reuse frying oil. There are some good tips at the sites below. Let it cool fully then filter out food particles (I use coffee filters and a funnel for this; it can be a slow drain, be patient) Refrigerate used oil to retard bacterial growth  Stop using it if it looks weird or smells funny! http://www.seriouseats.com/2013/09/ask-the-food-lab-how-many-times-can-i-reuse-fry-oil.html http://extension.psu.edu/food/preservation/faq/questions-and-answers-about-re-using-frying-oil http://www.epicurious.com/expert-advice/you-can-reuse-frying-oil-article </RelAText>

        <RelAText>I'd dare say a small amount of oil can work if there is ample,controlled resupply of heat - why would it make much difference if it is coming from the vessel wall or more oil. However, I found that deep friers are just not designed for that, relying on the oil fill as thermal mass a lot... even or especially the small &quot;fondue&quot; style ones*. TL;DR for the rest of post: Advice on deep frying without using a fryer. Use at your own risk. You are better off with a chip pan/wok/pot and a thermometer for the kind of job where you just want to oil-blanch an ingredient and/or want to minimise oil usage because you do not want to reuse it (eg you want to fry tofu in fresh oil because it tends to be a magnet for the worst flavors it can get from old oil, you want to deep fry something with a strongly spiced and/or unruly rub/breading/batter on it, you want to fry ingredients like carrots or red bell pepper that will discolor the oil, you want to heat the oil very high initially to account for a temperature drop). The largest plate on even a normal electric hob is around 2000W - same as a medium sized home deep fryer, and pots and pans are optimized to transfer these 2000W to what is in them.  If you are not confident with open deep frying, have someone who is work with you for a while - yes it is hazardous, but manageably so - never leave the setup unattended. especially if no food in oil, monitor thermometer closely. always have something made of metal (nothing else) in reach that can cover the pot. always assume something can boil over. keep clutter away from your work area. use really high-heat oil - peanut, refined safflower, soy, rice bran; not some unspecified compound oil with a 180°C warning. be especially careful with induction, can heat a pot with small amounts of liquid in them alarmingly quick. keep the lid off as long as you are heating. if working on gas, ask someone who has experience in doing so for additional advice (overboiling into the burner is an obvious danger!), i'm electric... *the small ones that are partially plastic in construction - never managed to set a grease fire, but I think I would be far more at a loss to control one with these things than in a pot... </RelAText>

        <RelAText>I've used two different home-kitchen deep fryers over the last 18 years or so; one of them was essentially a kettle with a hidden heating element, and the other has a removable heating element that sits under the frying basket. The early one I used, the type with the hidden heating element, really has no minimum other than the basic rule-of-thumb that want at least 3x-4x the volume of oil to food being cooked, so that the oil doesn't cool down too quickly. The basket was the other factor, but if I remember correctly, my basket got pretty close to the bottom of the pan, so that wasn't a major consideration. A more serious model that I now use, which has a feature for filtering/draining oil, a more convincing thermostat, and electronic timers, has some more serious constraints, notably a minimum oil content of about 2.5 liters, and a maximum of maybe a tad over three liters. The minimum is pretty simple to explain: If you use less than 2.5 liters, none of the food will have enough room to float above the basket. You probably won't even cover the heating element without at least a liter of oil in there. Not covering the heating element has some serious consequences, namely the risk of the element glowing and eventually over-heating (based on the thermostat probe placement), oil spatter, and the more practical one of not being able to use the basket. The maximum fill line is an approximation designed to reduce the risk of oil boil-over. Having dealt with a oil boil-over on a friteuse meant for stovetop use in my starving student days in Germany, I can tell you the consequences are unpleasant. I had scars to prove it. High water content in some foods leads to furious bubbling, and if those bubbles manage to carry oil over the side of the pan, bad things happen. </RelAText>

          <RelACText>That was my thought, too -- I've seen way too many fryers where the basket stays an inch or two above the bottom, so a good deal of the oil is more heat-sync than actually coming into contact w/ the food.</RelACText>

        <RelAText>The whole point of deep frying is to use large amounts of oil. You don't want to just coat the food. You really need to have the food swim in a mass of oil much larger than the mass of the food. Else the food will cool down the oil locally and you won't get the desired crust.  So no, as long as you are using a large basket (which holds a large amount of food), you can't do proper deep frying with a small amount of oil. A consumer style deep fryer is probably already on the low side of the correct oil/food ratio.  </RelAText>

A few weeks ago I decided to try substituting the same quantity of home-made  greek-style yogurt in place of the whipping cream. They did not tenderize at all and although being fully cooked, were ‘crunchy’ and not desireable. As an experiment yesterday, I did another batch with part of it done with the original recipe using whipping cream,,  the rest with yogurt. All packets were done on the same grill side-by side with exactly the same time  temp. The packets with whipping cream were done perfectly  again the ones with yogurt were tough. My internet searches have not found any answers as to why this happened. In addition to wanting to understand the science of this difference, can anyone suggest changes I can make to have this substitution work? </RelQBody>

        <RelCText>Without seeing the recipe (permissions issue - it is not a public doc) it is hard to know if something else is going on, but at a minimum, the water content in cream is significantly higher than in Greek-style (strained) yogurt. I suspect that a non-strained yogurt would probably have a similar result to your cream version. You can also &quot;reconstitute&quot; strained yogurt by mixing water or milk in to give it a thinner texture which would also probably work. I doubt it is a chemical reaction, but the recipe would help.</RelCText>

        <RelAText>The amount of grease the meat exudes is dependent upon the amount of fat in the beef. If your beef is lean (10% fat), you will not likely notice a difference in the greasiness in the final product by not straining. If your meat is fatty (ground beef in the US can contain up to 30% fat), then the final product will have noticeable grease. The fat contributes in a good way (IMO) to the flavor and mouth-feel of chili if the meat is in the 15% range.  </RelAText>

        <RelCText>Have to suspect something about your cooking practices contributes to any issues you are having with PTFE. I did finally replace my 20 year old frying pan with a new one a few years back (as much for the new, thicker aluminum part as for a new cooking surface.) I don't use the PTFE for high-heat applications it's unsuited to, and I use non-metallic utensils appropriate for not scratching up the surface. OTOH, the iron skillet I went off to college with is still going strong, but I use them for different things...</RelCText>

        <RelCText>Possibly, I have changed a few things over time. When I brown meat for the slow cooker, I now use cast iron. I've warped a few aluminum non sticks doing this because I add water to the pan to get the browning out to add to the roast.

        <RelAText>I find that the chemical and mechanical reactions between egg-white, egg-yolk and sugar is quite an delicate and complex one. I find that there is even a difference in using white refined cane sugar and white refined beet sugars when baking and the amount of effort of creaming eggs and sugar. Sugar substitutes that claim that they &quot;behave&quot; the same as sugar also don't seem to react in a manner that you'd expect. I would suggest that you try a range of sugars... The worse of them seems to be corn based sugars. The eggs just don't behave at all... </RelAText>

        <RelQSubject>what determines the texture of cookies</RelQSubject>
        <RelQBody>so the question is pretty much straight forward..  I ate all kinds of cookies, some of them are soft and fluffy, other chewy (like granola bars or choc chip cookies) and others really crispy and hard (like some gingerbread). I tried to compare the ingredients on some of the products, but didn't find any significant difference.  So what is it really, that determines the texture of the baked goods? </RelQBody>

        <RelAText>First, it is the ingredients. For example, shortbread cookies don't have liquid, while other types do have liquid. This makes them quite different. Also, there might be ingredients you didn't pay much attention to (mono- and diglycerides, for example, which might have been present at the end as an E number only), but they still can change the mouthfeel a lot.  The second thing is the ratio of the ingredients. The same ingredients in a different ratio will work to give you a different texture.  The third thing is the process. Depending on the order of combining the ingredients, and the amount of mixing, and whether you chill them (and when, and for how long) you end up with completely different textures out of the same ingredients. It is like starting with carbon and ending up with graphite, graphene or diamonds, depending on how you do it.  The fourth thing is the baking process. You can change the temperature and time to achieve different final results.  I realize this list is very, very general. But listing all possible results which can be achieved at each step would make this a small book. Each of the four steps gives you a large number of parameters to change, which changes the end result too.  </RelAText>

        <RelAText>If you have room to place the Wellingtons on the same shelf, you simply cook them in the same way as you would a single one. Conventional ovens do not work like microwaves - the amount of stuff in the oven makes no difference, providing air flow is maintained and you don't have something large right up at the top or bottom blocking an element. Fan ovens are especially useful as they actively circulate the heat around the oven cavity, so you can cook things on two different levels with fairly good consistency. </RelAText>

        <RelAText>I recon it has formed like a cake after cooling. The best option you have is to take a big chunk of it in a microwaveable container (making sure that you are not breaking the rice grains) and sprinkling with some water. Then cover with a cling film and microwave for 3-4 minutes from cold. Your rice grains will separate because of the extra moisture from the sprinkled water and the Pulao will become slightly moist.   But yes, Pulao is a dry dish and needs to be eaten with a side like Raita or Salan. </RelAText>

        <RelAText>Pulao is usually a &quot;dry&quot; dish without any gravy/sauce left in it when it finishes cooking. If the rice seems to be fully cooked and the individual grains do not seem to be under cooked or slightly crunchy then I think it is probably correct.  Many people serve raita (I like a simple yoghurt-onion-tomato mix with some chili powder and salt) and green coriander chutney along with pulao or biryani which helps to make the overall experience less dry. I usually cook the marinade as well to make a gravy/salan to serve on the side when I make chicken biryani. </RelAText>

        <RelAText>Unless contaminated by, say, drinking straight out of the bottle, it will likely be safe to consume, but it will probably have deteriorated in quality. Sake which is no longer appealing to drink may be suitable for use in cooking; if you're not accustomed to cooking with sake, consider something simple, like potatoes simmered with a modest amount of water, sake, salt  pepper, soy sauce and butter. Low-alcohol beverages, whether fermented or slightly fortified, tend to deteriorate in quality over time, although they will become stale less slowly if their containers are sealed airtight and chilled. Port, marsala, sherry, vermouth, wine and sake all typically best consumed within a short time after opening, although the specific chemistry may vary. Some folks consider a sake that's been open, unrefrigerated, for more than a few weeks undrinkable. I don't know if I'm that rigid, but it's a good benchmark. I've seen certain sakes do ok for a few months in the refrigerator. </RelAText>

        <RelAText>It will keep until it doesn't. Eventually it will spoil, but because sake is considerably above the magic number for alcohol concentration to be self preserving when sealed (&gt;12.3% alcohol by volume), so long as you don't let any alcohol tolerant microbes into the bottle, then it will be fine. Smell it first,'if it smells earthy, throw it out, if it smells vinegary, you can use it but it's not rally sake anymore, it's rice wine vinegar. If you want, and if it's say half full, water it down and add a touch of cider vinegar to it. Cider vinegar isn't pasteurized so it will have live acetobacters in it and you can make your own vinegar. You need to cut the sake to half strength though otherwise it's too strong for the acetobacter to grow. </RelAText>

        <RelAText>Commercial pizza places usually use plastic dough proofing trays. They interlock and provide a relatively air-tight seal when they stack on top of each other. If you're looking for something that fits in your refrigerator, you should look into Artisan DoughMate trays. They are are 1/2 of the size of standard restaurant sized trays and you can fit a couple in your home fridge (Just under 18&quot; x 14&quot;) They stack with a very good air-tight seal and you just need a lid for the top one. You should be able to fit about six dough balls to a tray. If your only talking 2-3 dough balls then one tray would work, with a lid. But you also can look at aluminum dough pans. Some of these are also stackable with lids, and you put one dough ball into each one. I've often seen people spray the pans with oil so that the dough releases easily, or spray the dough balls so that if they spread into each other while proofing that don't make one massive dough ball. </RelAText>

        <RelAText>Try coating the dough ball with a little olive oil or a non-stick spray.  I don't know if that's the reason why but it's what I always do when baking bread and I never have a crust form during the rise. </RelAText>

        <RelAText>If you insist on using a damp cloth, you have to make it wet again and again, so this is quite cumbersome especially with long proofing times. Much easier is plastic wrap, which doesn't prevent the dough from rising if you use it to cover a sufficiently large bowl. Tightly wrapping the dough itself obviously won't work. My prefered method for these very long raises is a large food-safe plastic container with a lid. It doesn't have to be super-airtight and as I usually do a round of &quot;stretch and fold&quot; or quick punchdown every 12-24 hours I never had a problem with dried or overflowing dough.  </RelAText>

        <RelQSubject>Minimum amount of oil that should be used in deep fryer</RelQSubject>
        <RelQBody>I have bought a 3 liter deep fryer. There was a 1.5 liter one available too but I wanted a larger basket. This 3 liter deep fryer requires 2.5 liters oil minimum. I had no idea about this. This quantity seems too much.  Can I use less? Has anyone any idea what would happen if I use less than the recommended? If I cannot use less than the minimum what do I have to do to make it last longer? </RelQBody>

        <RelCText>If the company that puts out the fryer specifically says that 2.5 liters is required... is there a reason you think less would be OK? At the very least, we will need to know the brand and model of the one you have. There certainly may be some fryers that work with smaller amounts of oil but we can't tell you if yours is one of them if you don't tell us which fryer you have :)</RelCText>

        <RelAText>If you need a larger basket to fry the amount of food you want to cook, you need more oil as well. If you don't always want to make that much food (or use that much oil) then you need a smaller vessel for deep-frying, such as a second fryer or a small wok or kadai.  If you put less oil in than the minimum it may not cover the food and/or the oil could overheat, depending on how the fryer manages its temperature settings. Overheating oil can be dangerous and will also burn your food while leaving it raw inside. All around, something to avoid.  You can save and reuse frying oil. There are some good tips at the sites below. Let it cool fully then filter out food particles (I use coffee filters and a funnel for this; it can be a slow drain, be patient) Refrigerate used oil to retard bacterial growth  Stop using it if it looks weird or smells funny! http://www.seriouseats.com/2013/09/ask-the-food-lab-how-many-times-can-i-reuse-fry-oil.html http://extension.psu.edu/food/preservation/faq/questions-and-answers-about-re-using-frying-oil http://www.epicurious.com/expert-advice/you-can-reuse-frying-oil-article </RelAText>

        <RelAText>I'd dare say a small amount of oil can work if there is ample,controlled resupply of heat - why would it make much difference if it is coming from the vessel wall or more oil. However, I found that deep friers are just not designed for that, relying on the oil fill as thermal mass a lot... even or especially the small &quot;fondue&quot; style ones*. TL;DR for the rest of post: Advice on deep frying without using a fryer. Use at your own risk. You are better off with a chip pan/wok/pot and a thermometer for the kind of job where you just want to oil-blanch an ingredient and/or want to minimise oil usage because you do not want to reuse it (eg you want to fry tofu in fresh oil because it tends to be a magnet for the worst flavors it can get from old oil, you want to deep fry something with a strongly spiced and/or unruly rub/breading/batter on it, you want to fry ingredients like carrots or red bell pepper that will discolor the oil, you want to heat the oil very high initially to account for a temperature drop). The largest plate on even a normal electric hob is around 2000W - same as a medium sized home deep fryer, and pots and pans are optimized to transfer these 2000W to what is in them.  If you are not confident with open deep frying, have someone who is work with you for a while - yes it is hazardous, but manageably so - never leave the setup unattended. especially if no food in oil, monitor thermometer closely. always have something made of metal (nothing else) in reach that can cover the pot. always assume something can boil over. keep clutter away from your work area. use really high-heat oil - peanut, refined safflower, soy, rice bran; not some unspecified compound oil with a 180°C warning. be especially careful with induction, can heat a pot with small amounts of liquid in them alarmingly quick. keep the lid off as long as you are heating. if working on gas, ask someone who has experience in doing so for additional advice (overboiling into the burner is an obvious danger!), i'm electric... *the small ones that are partially plastic in construction - never managed to set a grease fire, but I think I would be far more at a loss to control one with these things than in a pot... </RelAText>

        <RelAText>I've used two different home-kitchen deep fryers over the last 18 years or so; one of them was essentially a kettle with a hidden heating element, and the other has a removable heating element that sits under the frying basket. The early one I used, the type with the hidden heating element, really has no minimum other than the basic rule-of-thumb that want at least 3x-4x the volume of oil to food being cooked, so that the oil doesn't cool down too quickly. The basket was the other factor, but if I remember correctly, my basket got pretty close to the bottom of the pan, so that wasn't a major consideration. A more serious model that I now use, which has a feature for filtering/draining oil, a more convincing thermostat, and electronic timers, has some more serious constraints, notably a minimum oil content of about 2.5 liters, and a maximum of maybe a tad over three liters. The minimum is pretty simple to explain: If you use less than 2.5 liters, none of the food will have enough room to float above the basket. You probably won't even cover the heating element without at least a liter of oil in there. Not covering the heating element has some serious consequences, namely the risk of the element glowing and eventually over-heating (based on the thermostat probe placement), oil spatter, and the more practical one of not being able to use the basket. The maximum fill line is an approximation designed to reduce the risk of oil boil-over. Having dealt with a oil boil-over on a friteuse meant for stovetop use in my starving student days in Germany, I can tell you the consequences are unpleasant. I had scars to prove it. High water content in some foods leads to furious bubbling, and if those bubbles manage to carry oil over the side of the pan, bad things happen. </RelAText>

          <RelACText>That was my thought, too -- I've seen way too many fryers where the basket stays an inch or two above the bottom, so a good deal of the oil is more heat-sync than actually coming into contact w/ the food.</RelACText>

        <RelAText>The whole point of deep frying is to use large amounts of oil. You don't want to just coat the food. You really need to have the food swim in a mass of oil much larger than the mass of the food. Else the food will cool down the oil locally and you won't get the desired crust.  So no, as long as you are using a large basket (which holds a large amount of food), you can't do proper deep frying with a small amount of oil. A consumer style deep fryer is probably already on the low side of the correct oil/food ratio.  </RelAText>

        <RelQBody>I have a favorite tried  true recipe that I simply call ‘foil potatoes’.  recipe link: http://www.evernote.com/shard/s1/sh/048c56cc-1481-48b2-89e6-88e897da651a/b0c036a6448b07e0a486f77acf2111cb This has been made multiple times with consistently good results. A few weeks ago I decided to try substituting the same quantity of home-made  greek-style yogurt in place of the whipping cream. They did not tenderize at all and although being fully cooked, were ‘crunchy’ and not desireable. As an experiment yesterday, I did another batch with part of it done with the original recipe using whipping cream,,  the rest with yogurt. All packets were done on the same grill side-by side with exactly the same time  temp. The packets with whipping cream were done perfectly  again the ones with yogurt were tough. My internet searches have not found any answers as to why this happened. In addition to wanting to understand the science of this difference, can anyone suggest changes I can make to have this substitution work? </RelQBody>

        <RelCText>Without seeing the recipe (permissions issue - it is not a public doc) it is hard to know if something else is going on, but at a minimum, the water content in cream is significantly higher than in Greek-style (strained) yogurt. I suspect that a non-strained yogurt would probably have a similar result to your cream version. You can also &quot;reconstitute&quot; strained yogurt by mixing water or milk in to give it a thinner texture which would also probably work. I doubt it is a chemical reaction, but the recipe would help.</RelCText>

        <RelAText>The amount of grease the meat exudes is dependent upon the amount of fat in the beef. If your beef is lean (10% fat), you will not likely notice a difference in the greasiness in the final product by not straining. If your meat is fatty (ground beef in the US can contain up to 30% fat), then the final product will have noticeable grease. The fat contributes in a good way (IMO) to the flavor and mouth-feel of chili if the meat is in the 15% range.  </RelAText>

        <RelCText>Have to suspect something about your cooking practices contributes to any issues you are having with PTFE. I did finally replace my 20 year old frying pan with a new one a few years back (as much for the new, thicker aluminum part as for a new cooking surface.) I don't use the PTFE for high-heat applications it's unsuited to, and I use non-metallic utensils appropriate for not scratching up the surface. OTOH, the iron skillet I went off to college with is still going strong, but I use them for different things...</RelCText>

        <RelCText>Possibly, I have changed a few things over time. When I brown meat for the slow cooker, I now use cast iron. I've warped a few aluminum non sticks doing this because I add water to the pan to get the browning out to add to the roast.

        <RelAText>Use maple sugar.  Things will taste better*, but cost more. *unless, of course, you are a person who does not like real maple (of whom there are a surprising number, though I cannot claim to understand that.) For ice cream/sorbet/gelato/frozen desserts, most &quot;sugar substitutes&quot; (low calorie sweeteners, etc) don't really work, as sugar plays an important structural role in how ice cream turns out. Being sugar, maple sugar (or other &quot;unrefined/less refined&quot; sugars) work fine. </RelAText>

        <RelAText>I find that the chemical and mechanical reactions between egg-white, egg-yolk and sugar is quite an delicate and complex one. I find that there is even a difference in using white refined cane sugar and white refined beet sugars when baking and the amount of effort of creaming eggs and sugar. Sugar substitutes that claim that they &quot;behave&quot; the same as sugar also don't seem to react in a manner that you'd expect. I would suggest that you try a range of sugars...

        <RelAText>If you have room to place the Wellingtons on the same shelf, you simply cook them in the same way as you would a single one. Conventional ovens do not work like microwaves - the amount of stuff in the oven makes no difference, providing air flow is maintained and you don't have something large right up at the top or bottom blocking an element. Fan ovens are especially useful as they actively circulate the heat around the oven cavity, so you can cook things on two different levels with fairly good consistency. </RelAText>

        <RelAText>I recon it has formed like a cake after cooling. The best option you have is to take a big chunk of it in a microwaveable container (making sure that you are not breaking the rice grains) and sprinkling with some water. Then cover with a cling film and microwave for 3-4 minutes from cold. Your rice grains will separate because of the extra moisture from the sprinkled water and the Pulao will become slightly moist.   But yes, Pulao is a dry dish and needs to be eaten with a side like Raita or Salan. </RelAText>

        <RelAText>Pulao is usually a &quot;dry&quot; dish without any gravy/sauce left in it when it finishes cooking. If the rice seems to be fully cooked and the individual grains do not seem to be under cooked or slightly crunchy then I think it is probably correct.  Many people serve raita (I like a simple yoghurt-onion-tomato mix with some chili powder and salt) and green coriander chutney along with pulao or biryani which helps to make the overall experience less dry. I usually cook the marinade as well to make a gravy/salan to serve on the side when I make chicken biryani. </RelAText>

        <RelAText>Unless contaminated by, say, drinking straight out of the bottle, it will likely be safe to consume, but it will probably have deteriorated in quality. Sake which is no longer appealing to drink may be suitable for use in cooking; if you're not accustomed to cooking with sake, consider something simple, like potatoes simmered with a modest amount of water, sake, salt  pepper, soy sauce and butter. Low-alcohol beverages, whether fermented or slightly fortified, tend to deteriorate in quality over time, although they will become stale less slowly if their containers are sealed airtight and chilled. Port, marsala, sherry, vermouth, wine and sake all typically best consumed within a short time after opening, although the specific chemistry may vary. Some folks consider a sake that's been open, unrefrigerated, for more than a few weeks undrinkable. I don't know if I'm that rigid, but it's a good benchmark. I've seen certain sakes do ok for a few months in the refrigerator. </RelAText>

        <RelAText>It will keep until it doesn't. Eventually it will spoil, but because sake is considerably above the magic number for alcohol concentration to be self preserving when sealed (&gt;12.3% alcohol by volume), so long as you don't let any alcohol tolerant microbes into the bottle, then it will be fine. Smell it first,'if it smells earthy, throw it out, if it smells vinegary, you can use it but it's not rally sake anymore, it's rice wine vinegar. If you want, and if it's say half full, water it down and add a touch of cider vinegar to it. Cider vinegar isn't pasteurized so it will have live acetobacters in it and you can make your own vinegar. You need to cut the sake to half strength though otherwise it's too strong for the acetobacter to grow. </RelAText>

        <RelAText>Commercial pizza places usually use plastic dough proofing trays. They interlock and provide a relatively air-tight seal when they stack on top of each other. If you're looking for something that fits in your refrigerator, you should look into Artisan DoughMate trays. They are are 1/2 of the size of standard restaurant sized trays and you can fit a couple in your home fridge (Just under 18&quot; x 14&quot;) They stack with a very good air-tight seal and you just need a lid for the top one. You should be able to fit about six dough balls to a tray. If your only talking 2-3 dough balls then one tray would work, with a lid. But you also can look at aluminum dough pans. Some of these are also stackable with lids, and you put one dough ball into each one. I've often seen people spray the pans with oil so that the dough releases easily, or spray the dough balls so that if they spread into each other while proofing that don't make one massive dough ball. </RelAText>

        <RelAText>Try coating the dough ball with a little olive oil or a non-stick spray.  I don't know if that's the reason why but it's what I always do when baking bread and I never have a crust form during the rise. </RelAText>

        <RelAText>If you insist on using a damp cloth, you have to make it wet again and again, so this is quite cumbersome especially with long proofing times. Much easier is plastic wrap, which doesn't prevent the dough from rising if you use it to cover a sufficiently large bowl. Tightly wrapping the dough itself obviously won't work. My prefered method for these very long raises is a large food-safe plastic container with a lid. It doesn't have to be super-airtight and as I usually do a round of &quot;stretch and fold&quot; or quick punchdown every 12-24 hours I never had a problem with dried or overflowing dough.  </RelAText>

        <RelAText>If you need a larger basket to fry the amount of food you want to cook, you need more oil as well. If you don't always want to make that much food (or use that much oil) then you need a smaller vessel for deep-frying, such as a second fryer or a small wok or kadai.  If you put less oil in than the minimum it may not cover the food and/or the oil could overheat, depending on how the fryer manages its temperature settings. Overheating oil can be dangerous and will also burn your food while leaving it raw inside. All around, something to avoid.  You can save and reuse frying oil. There are some good tips at the sites below. Let it cool fully then filter out food particles (I use coffee filters and a funnel for this; it can be a slow drain, be patient) Refrigerate used oil to retard bacterial growth  Stop using it if it looks weird or smells funny! http://www.seriouseats.com/2013/09/ask-the-food-lab-how-many-times-can-i-reuse-fry-oil.html http://extension.psu.edu/food/preservation/faq/questions-and-answers-about-re-using-frying-oil http://www.epicurious.com/expert-advice/you-can-reuse-frying-oil-article </RelAText>

        <RelAText>I'd dare say a small amount of oil can work if there is ample,controlled resupply of heat - why would it make much difference if it is coming from the vessel wall or more oil. However, I found that deep friers are just not designed for that, relying on the oil fill as thermal mass a lot... even or especially the small &quot;fondue&quot; style ones*. TL;DR for the rest of post: Advice on deep frying without using a fryer. Use at your own risk. You are better off with a chip pan/wok/pot and a thermometer for the kind of job where you just want to oil-blanch an ingredient and/or want to minimise oil usage because you do not want to reuse it (eg you want to fry tofu in fresh oil because it tends to be a magnet for the worst flavors it can get from old oil, you want to deep fry something with a strongly spiced and/or unruly rub/breading/batter on it, you want to fry ingredients like carrots or red bell pepper that will discolor the oil, you want to heat the oil very high initially to account for a temperature drop). The largest plate on even a normal electric hob is around 2000W - same as a medium sized home deep fryer, and pots and pans are optimized to transfer these 2000W to what is in them.  If you are not confident with open deep frying, have someone who is work with you for a while - yes it is hazardous, but manageably so - never leave the setup unattended. especially if no food in oil, monitor thermometer closely. always have something made of metal (nothing else) in reach that can cover the pot. always assume something can boil over. keep clutter away from your work area. use really high-heat oil - peanut, refined safflower, soy, rice bran; not some unspecified compound oil with a 180°C warning. be especially careful with induction, can heat a pot with small amounts of liquid in them alarmingly quick. keep the lid off as long as you are heating. if working on gas, ask someone who has experience in doing so for additional advice (overboiling into the burner is an obvious danger!), i'm electric... *the small ones that are partially plastic in construction - never managed to set a grease fire, but I think I would be far more at a loss to control one with these things than in a pot... </RelAText>

        <RelAText>I've used two different home-kitchen deep fryers over the last 18 years or so; one of them was essentially a kettle with a hidden heating element, and the other has a removable heating element that sits under the frying basket. The early one I used, the type with the hidden heating element, really has no minimum other than the basic rule-of-thumb that want at least 3x-4x the volume of oil to food being cooked, so that the oil doesn't cool down too quickly. The basket was the other factor, but if I remember correctly, my basket got pretty close to the bottom of the pan, so that wasn't a major consideration. A more serious model that I now use, which has a feature for filtering/draining oil, a more convincing thermostat, and electronic timers, has some more serious constraints, notably a minimum oil content of about 2.5 liters, and a maximum of maybe a tad over three liters. The minimum is pretty simple to explain: If you use less than 2.5 liters, none of the food will have enough room to float above the basket. You probably won't even cover the heating element without at least a liter of oil in there. Not covering the heating element has some serious consequences, namely the risk of the element glowing and eventually over-heating (based on the thermostat probe placement), oil spatter, and the more practical one of not being able to use the basket. The maximum fill line is an approximation designed to reduce the risk of oil boil-over. Having dealt with a oil boil-over on a friteuse meant for stovetop use in my starving student days in Germany, I can tell you the consequences are unpleasant. I had scars to prove it. High water content in some foods leads to furious bubbling, and if those bubbles manage to carry oil over the side of the pan, bad things happen. </RelAText>

          <RelACText>That was my thought, too -- I've seen way too many fryers where the basket stays an inch or two above the bottom, so a good deal of the oil is more heat-sync than actually coming into contact w/ the food.</RelACText>

        <RelAText>The whole point of deep frying is to use large amounts of oil. You don't want to just coat the food. You really need to have the food swim in a mass of oil much larger than the mass of the food. Else the food will cool down the oil locally and you won't get the desired crust.  So no, as long as you are using a large basket (which holds a large amount of food), you can't do proper deep frying with a small amount of oil. A consumer style deep fryer is probably already on the low side of the correct oil/food ratio.  </RelAText>

A few weeks ago I decided to try substituting the same quantity of home-made  greek-style yogurt in place of the whipping cream. They did not tenderize at all and although being fully cooked, were ‘crunchy’ and not desireable. As an experiment yesterday, I did another batch with part of it done with the original recipe using whipping cream,,  the rest with yogurt. All packets were done on the same grill side-by side with exactly the same time  temp. The packets with whipping cream were done perfectly  again the ones with yogurt were tough. My internet searches have not found any answers as to why this happened. In addition to wanting to understand the science of this difference, can anyone suggest changes I can make to have this substitution work? </RelQBody>

        <RelCText>Without seeing the recipe (permissions issue - it is not a public doc) it is hard to know if something else is going on, but at a minimum, the water content in cream is significantly higher than in Greek-style (strained) yogurt. I suspect that a non-strained yogurt would probably have a similar result to your cream version. You can also &quot;reconstitute&quot; strained yogurt by mixing water or milk in to give it a thinner texture which would also probably work. I doubt it is a chemical reaction, but the recipe would help.</RelCText>

        <RelAText>The amount of grease the meat exudes is dependent upon the amount of fat in the beef. If your beef is lean (10% fat), you will not likely notice a difference in the greasiness in the final product by not straining. If your meat is fatty (ground beef in the US can contain up to 30% fat), then the final product will have noticeable grease. The fat contributes in a good way (IMO) to the flavor and mouth-feel of chili if the meat is in the 15% range.  </RelAText>

        <RelCText>Have to suspect something about your cooking practices contributes to any issues you are having with PTFE. I did finally replace my 20 year old frying pan with a new one a few years back (as much for the new, thicker aluminum part as for a new cooking surface.) I don't use the PTFE for high-heat applications it's unsuited to, and I use non-metallic utensils appropriate for not scratching up the surface. OTOH, the iron skillet I went off to college with is still going strong, but I use them for different things...</RelCText>

        <RelCText>Possibly, I have changed a few things over time. When I brown meat for the slow cooker, I now use cast iron. I've warped a few aluminum non sticks doing this because I add water to the pan to get the browning out to add to the roast. Other than that it seems that most frying pans just wont stay flat and tend to shed their coatings withing 5 or 6 years.</RelCText>

Sugar substitutes that claim that they &quot;behave&quot; the same as sugar also don't seem to react in a manner that you'd expect. I would suggest that you try a range of sugars...

        <RelQSubject>Flavor in avocadoes gone forever?</RelQSubject>
        <RelQBody>I got some made-in-store supermarket guacamole yesterday and it was a new low in bland, watery, flavorless avocado meat. I have read that the reason modern avocadoes taste bland is because they use a variety called a &quot;Hass&quot; avocado that growers prefer because it is resistant to some kinds of blight and it does not spoil as readily as other varieties. Nevertheless, as someone who remembers as a boy getting avocadoes that tasted like, well, avocadoes and actually having good guacamole, it is really discouraging the world takeover of this tasteless drone avocado called the Hass. Also, it seems the Hass itself seems to be getting more bland and more watery year by year. Is there any way to get good avocado varieties of the old type that actually taste good, or have they gone the way of the Dodo? (I should mention that I grew up in San Diego, but now live in Massachusetts so this might be part of the problem; good avocadoes might only be available locally in Southern California.) Update By some further research I have found that apparently large numbers of avocadoes are being exported by Peru, and even though they are Hass avocadoes they are reputedly MUCH more bland than California avocadoes, but also much cheaper. So, this might be the problem, I am getting Peruvian avocadoes. </RelQBody>

        <RelCText>CA is in the midst of a drought. Haven't seen a good avocado from there all year.

        <RelCText>Good tropical fruit in Massachusetts is a rarity on all fronts. Picked underripe and shipped long distances does not ever compare well with picked at/near ripe from the farm up the road. Sometimes we see halfway decent Mexican or Florida avocados. Halfway decent is about as good as it gets.</RelCText>

        <RelAText>You're exactly right in figuring out that part of the problem is having grown up with some of the world's best avocadoes, and then moving up North where decent avocadoes are scarce!  :)  Tasty avocadoes aren't all going the way of the dodo just yet, but you might have to move to Texas or Florida, or check some Mexican markets in your area, to get better avocadoes.  My husband lived in S Calif. as a child. He is an avocado connoisseur like you, as a result. Some of the best S Cali avocadoes are 'Fuerte' variety, which is more flavorful and creamier than Hass. We live in Texas and we get some very good, tasty Mexican avocadoes here- which by the way, are Hass.  But every single avocado I've brought home to hubby, whether from Mexico, Chile, Florida, Arizona, the Caribbean, Hawaii, Guatemala or Peru, ends up being compared unfavorably to those great S Calif. avocados he remembers. We visited a relative in the S Calif. area about 4.5 years ago and hubby had a delicious, fresh S Cali 'Fuerte' variety avocado during that trip--an avocado which he still recalls most fondly.  Personally I tried that same S Cali 'Fuerte' avocado too on that trip and while it was a bit tastier than the Hass avocadoes we currently get in Texas, I didn't find the flavor all THAT much better!  But hubby did prefer it a lot; he likes what he was raised on. Also his palate is more sensitive to bitterness than mine and 'Fuerte' is less bitter than Hass. In recent years, Calif. drought has made the delicious Cali avocadoes, especially the 'Fuerte', nearly impossible to get.  By the way- I lived in Illinois for a while. That state has the same avocado problem as Massachusetts: too far away from where good avocadoes and other tropical fruits are grown, to get avocadoes with decent quality. Whatever does survive the shipping journey that far North is usually picked much too green. Around the holidays such as Christmas and 16 de Septiembre and 5 de Mayo etc., there was ONE Mexican food store in Chicago that got some fresh, air-flown ripe Mexican avocadoes for sale just for these special days..at $5 each!   Mom who was raised in Texas was desperate for a good avocado because they are almost nonexistent in Chicago, so she bought 2 of those $5 avocados for Christmas dinner and said it was worth it. I had a small taste in my salad, it was great but geez $5 a piece LOL! I'm real glad we left Chicago and moved to Texas soon after that! I wouldn't count on S. California's avocado crop doing well anytime in the near future, as that area is likely to only have worse and worse water shortages and drought problems as time goes forward.  So perhaps, sadly, the 'Fuerte' avocadoes and the other delicious S Cali avocadoes you were raised on are going the way of the dodo. I hope not because they are very good avocadoes and it's always nice to be able to get USA grown tropical fruits. But unless some amazing advances in water and climate management are made to save the Cali avocado farms from extinction, your delicious S Cali grown avocadoes may become nothing more than a fond memory. </RelAText>

        <RelAText>If you have room to place the Wellingtons on the same shelf, you simply cook them in the same way as you would a single one. Conventional ovens do not work like microwaves - the amount of stuff in the oven makes no difference, providing air flow is maintained and you don't have something large right up at the top or bottom blocking an element. Fan ovens are especially useful as they actively circulate the heat around the oven cavity, so you can cook things on two different levels with fairly good consistency. </RelAText>

        <RelAText>I recon it has formed like a cake after cooling. The best option you have is to take a big chunk of it in a microwaveable container (making sure that you are not breaking the rice grains) and sprinkling with some water. Then cover with a cling film and microwave for 3-4 minutes from cold. Your rice grains will separate because of the extra moisture from the sprinkled water and the Pulao will become slightly moist.   But yes, Pulao is a dry dish and needs to be eaten with a side like Raita or Salan. </RelAText>

        <RelAText>Pulao is usually a &quot;dry&quot; dish without any gravy/sauce left in it when it finishes cooking. If the rice seems to be fully cooked and the individual grains do not seem to be under cooked or slightly crunchy then I think it is probably correct.  Many people serve raita (I like a simple yoghurt-onion-tomato mix with some chili powder and salt) and green coriander chutney along with pulao or biryani which helps to make the overall experience less dry. I usually cook the marinade as well to make a gravy/salan to serve on the side when I make chicken biryani. </RelAText>

        <RelAText>Unless contaminated by, say, drinking straight out of the bottle, it will likely be safe to consume, but it will probably have deteriorated in quality. Sake which is no longer appealing to drink may be suitable for use in cooking; if you're not accustomed to cooking with sake, consider something simple, like potatoes simmered with a modest amount of water, sake, salt  pepper, soy sauce and butter. Low-alcohol beverages, whether fermented or slightly fortified, tend to deteriorate in quality over time, although they will become stale less slowly if their containers are sealed airtight and chilled. Port, marsala, sherry, vermouth, wine and sake all typically best consumed within a short time after opening, although the specific chemistry may vary. Some folks consider a sake that's been open, unrefrigerated, for more than a few weeks undrinkable. I don't know if I'm that rigid, but it's a good benchmark. I've seen certain sakes do ok for a few months in the refrigerator. </RelAText>

        <RelAText>It will keep until it doesn't. Eventually it will spoil, but because sake is considerably above the magic number for alcohol concentration to be self preserving when sealed (&gt;12.3% alcohol by volume), so long as you don't let any alcohol tolerant microbes into the bottle, then it will be fine. Smell it first,'if it smells earthy, throw it out, if it smells vinegary, you can use it but it's not rally sake anymore, it's rice wine vinegar. If you want, and if it's say half full, water it down and add a touch of cider vinegar to it. Cider vinegar isn't pasteurized so it will have live acetobacters in it and you can make your own vinegar. You need to cut the sake to half strength though otherwise it's too strong for the acetobacter to grow. </RelAText>

        <RelAText>Commercial pizza places usually use plastic dough proofing trays. They interlock and provide a relatively air-tight seal when they stack on top of each other. If you're looking for something that fits in your refrigerator, you should look into Artisan DoughMate trays. They are are 1/2 of the size of standard restaurant sized trays and you can fit a couple in your home fridge (Just under 18&quot; x 14&quot;) They stack with a very good air-tight seal and you just need a lid for the top one. You should be able to fit about six dough balls to a tray. If your only talking 2-3 dough balls then one tray would work, with a lid. But you also can look at aluminum dough pans. Some of these are also stackable with lids, and you put one dough ball into each one. I've often seen people spray the pans with oil so that the dough releases easily, or spray the dough balls so that if they spread into each other while proofing that don't make one massive dough ball. </RelAText>

        <RelAText>Try coating the dough ball with a little olive oil or a non-stick spray.  I don't know if that's the reason why but it's what I always do when baking bread and I never have a crust form during the rise. </RelAText>

        <RelAText>If you insist on using a damp cloth, you have to make it wet again and again, so this is quite cumbersome especially with long proofing times. Much easier is plastic wrap, which doesn't prevent the dough from rising if you use it to cover a sufficiently large bowl. Tightly wrapping the dough itself obviously won't work. My prefered method for these very long raises is a large food-safe plastic container with a lid. It doesn't have to be super-airtight and as I usually do a round of &quot;stretch and fold&quot; or quick punchdown every 12-24 hours I never had a problem with dried or overflowing dough.  </RelAText>

        <RelCText>If the company that puts out the fryer specifically says that 2.5 liters is required... is there a reason you think less would be OK? At the very least, we will need to know the brand and model of the one you have. There certainly may be some fryers that work with smaller amounts of oil but we can't tell you if yours is one of them if you don't tell us which fryer you have :)</RelCText>

        <RelAText>If you need a larger basket to fry the amount of food you want to cook, you need more oil as well. If you don't always want to make that much food (or use that much oil) then you need a smaller vessel for deep-frying, such as a second fryer or a small wok or kadai.  If you put less oil in than the minimum it may not cover the food and/or the oil could overheat, depending on how the fryer manages its temperature settings. Overheating oil can be dangerous and will also burn your food while leaving it raw inside. All around, something to avoid.  You can save and reuse frying oil. There are some good tips at the sites below. Let it cool fully then filter out food particles (I use coffee filters and a funnel for this; it can be a slow drain, be patient) Refrigerate used oil to retard bacterial growth  Stop using it if it looks weird or smells funny! http://www.seriouseats.com/2013/09/ask-the-food-lab-how-many-times-can-i-reuse-fry-oil.html http://extension.psu.edu/food/preservation/faq/questions-and-answers-about-re-using-frying-oil http://www.epicurious.com/expert-advice/you-can-reuse-frying-oil-article </RelAText>

        <RelAText>I'd dare say a small amount of oil can work if there is ample,controlled resupply of heat - why would it make much difference if it is coming from the vessel wall or more oil. However, I found that deep friers are just not designed for that, relying on the oil fill as thermal mass a lot... even or especially the small &quot;fondue&quot; style ones*. TL;DR for the rest of post: Advice on deep frying without using a fryer. Use at your own risk. You are better off with a chip pan/wok/pot and a thermometer for the kind of job where you just want to oil-blanch an ingredient and/or want to minimise oil usage because you do not want to reuse it (eg you want to fry tofu in fresh oil because it tends to be a magnet for the worst flavors it can get from old oil, you want to deep fry something with a strongly spiced and/or unruly rub/breading/batter on it, you want to fry ingredients like carrots or red bell pepper that will discolor the oil, you want to heat the oil very high initially to account for a temperature drop). The largest plate on even a normal electric hob is around 2000W - same as a medium sized home deep fryer, and pots and pans are optimized to transfer these 2000W to what is in them.  If you are not confident with open deep frying, have someone who is work with you for a while - yes it is hazardous, but manageably so - never leave the setup unattended. especially if no food in oil, monitor thermometer closely. always have something made of metal (nothing else) in reach that can cover the pot. always assume something can boil over. keep clutter away from your work area. use really high-heat oil - peanut, refined safflower, soy, rice bran; not some unspecified compound oil with a 180°C warning. be especially careful with induction, can heat a pot with small amounts of liquid in them alarmingly quick. keep the lid off as long as you are heating. if working on gas, ask someone who has experience in doing so for additional advice (overboiling into the burner is an obvious danger!), i'm electric... *the small ones that are partially plastic in construction - never managed to set a grease fire, but I think I would be far more at a loss to control one with these things than in a pot... </RelAText>

        <RelAText>I've used two different home-kitchen deep fryers over the last 18 years or so; one of them was essentially a kettle with a hidden heating element, and the other has a removable heating element that sits under the frying basket. The early one I used, the type with the hidden heating element, really has no minimum other than the basic rule-of-thumb that want at least 3x-4x the volume of oil to food being cooked, so that the oil doesn't cool down too quickly. The basket was the other factor, but if I remember correctly, my basket got pretty close to the bottom of the pan, so that wasn't a major consideration. A more serious model that I now use, which has a feature for filtering/draining oil, a more convincing thermostat, and electronic timers, has some more serious constraints, notably a minimum oil content of about 2.5 liters, and a maximum of maybe a tad over three liters. The minimum is pretty simple to explain: If you use less than 2.5 liters, none of the food will have enough room to float above the basket. You probably won't even cover the heating element without at least a liter of oil in there. Not covering the heating element has some serious consequences, namely the risk of the element glowing and eventually over-heating (based on the thermostat probe placement), oil spatter, and the more practical one of not being able to use the basket. The maximum fill line is an approximation designed to reduce the risk of oil boil-over. Having dealt with a oil boil-over on a friteuse meant for stovetop use in my starving student days in Germany, I can tell you the consequences are unpleasant. I had scars to prove it. High water content in some foods leads to furious bubbling, and if those bubbles manage to carry oil over the side of the pan, bad things happen. </RelAText>

          <RelACText>That was my thought, too -- I've seen way too many fryers where the basket stays an inch or two above the bottom, so a good deal of the oil is more heat-sync than actually coming into contact w/ the food.</RelACText>

        <RelAText>The whole point of deep frying is to use large amounts of oil. You don't want to just coat the food. You really need to have the food swim in a mass of oil much larger than the mass of the food. Else the food will cool down the oil locally and you won't get the desired crust.  So no, as long as you are using a large basket (which holds a large amount of food), you can't do proper deep frying with a small amount of oil. A consumer style deep fryer is probably already on the low side of the correct oil/food ratio.  </RelAText>

A few weeks ago I decided to try substituting the same quantity of home-made  greek-style yogurt in place of the whipping cream. They did not tenderize at all and although being fully cooked, were ‘crunchy’ and not desireable. As an experiment yesterday, I did another batch with part of it done with the original recipe using whipping cream,,  the rest with yogurt. All packets were done on the same grill side-by side with exactly the same time  temp. The packets with whipping cream were done perfectly  again the ones with yogurt were tough. My internet searches have not found any answers as to why this happened. In addition to wanting to understand the science of this difference, can anyone suggest changes I can make to have this substitution work? </RelQBody>

        <RelCText>Without seeing the recipe (permissions issue - it is not a public doc) it is hard to know if something else is going on, but at a minimum, the water content in cream is significantly higher than in Greek-style (strained) yogurt. I suspect that a non-strained yogurt would probably have a similar result to your cream version. You can also &quot;reconstitute&quot; strained yogurt by mixing water or milk in to give it a thinner texture which would also probably work. I doubt it is a chemical reaction, but the recipe would help.</RelCText>

        <RelAText>The amount of grease the meat exudes is dependent upon the amount of fat in the beef. If your beef is lean (10% fat), you will not likely notice a difference in the greasiness in the final product by not straining. If your meat is fatty (ground beef in the US can contain up to 30% fat), then the final product will have noticeable grease. The fat contributes in a good way (IMO) to the flavor and mouth-feel of chili if the meat is in the 15% range.  </RelAText>

        <RelCText>Have to suspect something about your cooking practices contributes to any issues you are having with PTFE. I did finally replace my 20 year old frying pan with a new one a few years back (as much for the new, thicker aluminum part as for a new cooking surface.) I don't use the PTFE for high-heat applications it's unsuited to, and I use non-metallic utensils appropriate for not scratching up the surface.

        <RelCText>Possibly, I have changed a few things over time. When I brown meat for the slow cooker, I now use cast iron. I've warped a few aluminum non sticks doing this because I add water to the pan to get the browning out to add to the roast.

        <RelAText>I find that the chemical and mechanical reactions between egg-white, egg-yolk and sugar is quite an delicate and complex one. I find that there is even a difference in using white refined cane sugar and white refined beet sugars when baking and the amount of effort of creaming eggs and sugar. Sugar substitutes that claim that they &quot;behave&quot; the same as sugar also don't seem to react in a manner that you'd expect. I would suggest that you try a range of sugars... The worse of them seems to be corn based sugars. The eggs just don't behave at all... </RelAText>

        <RelQSubject>Flavor in avocadoes gone forever?</RelQSubject>
        <RelQBody>I got some made-in-store supermarket guacamole yesterday and it was a new low in bland, watery, flavorless avocado meat. I have read that the reason modern avocadoes taste bland is because they use a variety called a &quot;Hass&quot; avocado that growers prefer because it is resistant to some kinds of blight and it does not spoil as readily as other varieties. Nevertheless, as someone who remembers as a boy getting avocadoes that tasted like, well, avocadoes and actually having good guacamole, it is really discouraging the world takeover of this tasteless drone avocado called the Hass. Also, it seems the Hass itself seems to be getting more bland and more watery year by year. Is there any way to get good avocado varieties of the old type that actually taste good, or have they gone the way of the Dodo? (I should mention that I grew up in San Diego, but now live in Massachusetts so this might be part of the problem; good avocadoes might only be available locally in Southern California.) Update By some further research I have found that apparently large numbers of avocadoes are being exported by Peru, and even though they are Hass avocadoes they are reputedly MUCH more bland than California avocadoes, but also much cheaper. So, this might be the problem, I am getting Peruvian avocadoes. </RelQBody>

Picked underripe and shipped long distances does not ever compare well with picked at/near ripe from the farm up the road. Sometimes we see halfway decent Mexican or Florida avocados.

        <RelAText>You're exactly right in figuring out that part of the problem is having grown up with some of the world's best avocadoes, and then moving up North where decent avocadoes are scarce!  :)  Tasty avocadoes aren't all going the way of the dodo just yet, but you might have to move to Texas or Florida, or check some Mexican markets in your area, to get better avocadoes.  My husband lived in S Calif. as a child. He is an avocado connoisseur like you, as a result. Some of the best S Cali avocadoes are 'Fuerte' variety, which is more flavorful and creamier than Hass. We live in Texas and we get some very good, tasty Mexican avocadoes here- which by the way, are Hass.  But every single avocado I've brought home to hubby, whether from Mexico, Chile, Florida, Arizona, the Caribbean, Hawaii, Guatemala or Peru, ends up being compared unfavorably to those great S Calif. avocados he remembers. We visited a relative in the S Calif. area about 4.5 years ago and hubby had a delicious, fresh S Cali 'Fuerte' variety avocado during that trip--an avocado which he still recalls most fondly.  Personally I tried that same S Cali 'Fuerte' avocado too on that trip and while it was a bit tastier than the Hass avocadoes we currently get in Texas, I didn't find the flavor all THAT much better!  But hubby did prefer it a lot; he likes what he was raised on. Also his palate is more sensitive to bitterness than mine and 'Fuerte' is less bitter than Hass. In recent years, Calif. drought has made the delicious Cali avocadoes, especially the 'Fuerte', nearly impossible to get.  By the way- I lived in Illinois for a while. That state has the same avocado problem as Massachusetts: too far away from where good avocadoes and other tropical fruits are grown, to get avocadoes with decent quality. Whatever does survive the shipping journey that far North is usually picked much too green. Around the holidays such as Christmas and 16 de Septiembre and 5 de Mayo etc., there was ONE Mexican food store in Chicago that got some fresh, air-flown ripe Mexican avocadoes for sale just for these special days..at $5 each!   Mom who was raised in Texas was desperate for a good avocado because they are almost nonexistent in Chicago, so she bought 2 of those $5 avocados for Christmas dinner and said it was worth it. I had a small taste in my salad, it was great but geez $5 a piece LOL! I'm real glad we left Chicago and moved to Texas soon after that! I wouldn't count on S. California's avocado crop doing well anytime in the near future, as that area is likely to only have worse and worse water shortages and drought problems as time goes forward.  So perhaps, sadly, the 'Fuerte' avocadoes and the other delicious S Cali avocadoes you were raised on are going the way of the dodo. I hope not because they are very good avocadoes and it's always nice to be able to get USA grown tropical fruits. But unless some amazing advances in water and climate management are made to save the Cali avocado farms from extinction, your delicious S Cali grown avocadoes may become nothing more than a fond memory. </RelAText>

        <RelAText>If you have room to place the Wellingtons on the same shelf, you simply cook them in the same way as you would a single one. Conventional ovens do not work like microwaves - the amount of stuff in the oven makes no difference, providing air flow is maintained and you don't have something large right up at the top or bottom blocking an element. Fan ovens are especially useful as they actively circulate the heat around the oven cavity, so you can cook things on two different levels with fairly good consistency. </RelAText>

        <RelAText>I recon it has formed like a cake after cooling. The best option you have is to take a big chunk of it in a microwaveable container (making sure that you are not breaking the rice grains) and sprinkling with some water. Then cover with a cling film and microwave for 3-4 minutes from cold. Your rice grains will separate because of the extra moisture from the sprinkled water and the Pulao will become slightly moist.   But yes, Pulao is a dry dish and needs to be eaten with a side like Raita or Salan. </RelAText>

        <RelAText>Pulao is usually a &quot;dry&quot; dish without any gravy/sauce left in it when it finishes cooking. If the rice seems to be fully cooked and the individual grains do not seem to be under cooked or slightly crunchy then I think it is probably correct.  Many people serve raita (I like a simple yoghurt-onion-tomato mix with some chili powder and salt) and green coriander chutney along with pulao or biryani which helps to make the overall experience less dry. I usually cook the marinade as well to make a gravy/salan to serve on the side when I make chicken biryani. </RelAText>

        <RelAText>Unless contaminated by, say, drinking straight out of the bottle, it will likely be safe to consume, but it will probably have deteriorated in quality. Sake which is no longer appealing to drink may be suitable for use in cooking; if you're not accustomed to cooking with sake, consider something simple, like potatoes simmered with a modest amount of water, sake, salt  pepper, soy sauce and butter. Low-alcohol beverages, whether fermented or slightly fortified, tend to deteriorate in quality over time, although they will become stale less slowly if their containers are sealed airtight and chilled. Port, marsala, sherry, vermouth, wine and sake all typically best consumed within a short time after opening, although the specific chemistry may vary. Some folks consider a sake that's been open, unrefrigerated, for more than a few weeks undrinkable. I don't know if I'm that rigid, but it's a good benchmark. I've seen certain sakes do ok for a few months in the refrigerator. </RelAText>

        <RelAText>It will keep until it doesn't. Eventually it will spoil, but because sake is considerably above the magic number for alcohol concentration to be self preserving when sealed (&gt;12.3% alcohol by volume), so long as you don't let any alcohol tolerant microbes into the bottle, then it will be fine. Smell it first,'if it smells earthy, throw it out, if it smells vinegary, you can use it but it's not rally sake anymore, it's rice wine vinegar. If you want, and if it's say half full, water it down and add a touch of cider vinegar to it. Cider vinegar isn't pasteurized so it will have live acetobacters in it and you can make your own vinegar. You need to cut the sake to half strength though otherwise it's too strong for the acetobacter to grow. </RelAText>

        <RelAText>Commercial pizza places usually use plastic dough proofing trays. They interlock and provide a relatively air-tight seal when they stack on top of each other. If you're looking for something that fits in your refrigerator, you should look into Artisan DoughMate trays. They are are 1/2 of the size of standard restaurant sized trays and you can fit a couple in your home fridge (Just under 18&quot; x 14&quot;) They stack with a very good air-tight seal and you just need a lid for the top one. You should be able to fit about six dough balls to a tray. If your only talking 2-3 dough balls then one tray would work, with a lid. But you also can look at aluminum dough pans. Some of these are also stackable with lids, and you put one dough ball into each one. I've often seen people spray the pans with oil so that the dough releases easily, or spray the dough balls so that if they spread into each other while proofing that don't make one massive dough ball. </RelAText>

        <RelAText>Try coating the dough ball with a little olive oil or a non-stick spray.  I don't know if that's the reason why but it's what I always do when baking bread and I never have a crust form during the rise. </RelAText>

        <RelAText>If you insist on using a damp cloth, you have to make it wet again and again, so this is quite cumbersome especially with long proofing times. Much easier is plastic wrap, which doesn't prevent the dough from rising if you use it to cover a sufficiently large bowl. Tightly wrapping the dough itself obviously won't work. My prefered method for these very long raises is a large food-safe plastic container with a lid. It doesn't have to be super-airtight and as I usually do a round of &quot;stretch and fold&quot; or quick punchdown every 12-24 hours I never had a problem with dried or overflowing dough.  </RelAText>

        <RelQBody>I have bought a 3 liter deep fryer. There was a 1.5 liter one available too but I wanted a larger basket. This 3 liter deep fryer requires 2.5 liters oil minimum. I had no idea about this. This quantity seems too much.  Can I use less? Has anyone any idea what would happen if I use less than the recommended? If I cannot use less than the minimum what do I have to do to make it last longer? </RelQBody>

        <RelCText>If the company that puts out the fryer specifically says that 2.5 liters is required... is there a reason you think less would be OK? At the very least, we will need to know the brand and model of the one you have. There certainly may be some fryers that work with smaller amounts of oil but we can't tell you if yours is one of them if you don't tell us which fryer you have :)</RelCText>

        <RelAText>If you need a larger basket to fry the amount of food you want to cook, you need more oil as well. If you don't always want to make that much food (or use that much oil) then you need a smaller vessel for deep-frying, such as a second fryer or a small wok or kadai.  If you put less oil in than the minimum it may not cover the food and/or the oil could overheat, depending on how the fryer manages its temperature settings. Overheating oil can be dangerous and will also burn your food while leaving it raw inside. All around, something to avoid.  You can save and reuse frying oil. There are some good tips at the sites below. Let it cool fully then filter out food particles (I use coffee filters and a funnel for this; it can be a slow drain, be patient) Refrigerate used oil to retard bacterial growth  Stop using it if it looks weird or smells funny! http://www.seriouseats.com/2013/09/ask-the-food-lab-how-many-times-can-i-reuse-fry-oil.html http://extension.psu.edu/food/preservation/faq/questions-and-answers-about-re-using-frying-oil http://www.epicurious.com/expert-advice/you-can-reuse-frying-oil-article </RelAText>

        <RelAText>I'd dare say a small amount of oil can work if there is ample,controlled resupply of heat - why would it make much difference if it is coming from the vessel wall or more oil. However, I found that deep friers are just not designed for that, relying on the oil fill as thermal mass a lot... even or especially the small &quot;fondue&quot; style ones*. TL;DR for the rest of post: Advice on deep frying without using a fryer. Use at your own risk. You are better off with a chip pan/wok/pot and a thermometer for the kind of job where you just want to oil-blanch an ingredient and/or want to minimise oil usage because you do not want to reuse it (eg you want to fry tofu in fresh oil because it tends to be a magnet for the worst flavors it can get from old oil, you want to deep fry something with a strongly spiced and/or unruly rub/breading/batter on it, you want to fry ingredients like carrots or red bell pepper that will discolor the oil, you want to heat the oil very high initially to account for a temperature drop). The largest plate on even a normal electric hob is around 2000W - same as a medium sized home deep fryer, and pots and pans are optimized to transfer these 2000W to what is in them.  If you are not confident with open deep frying, have someone who is work with you for a while - yes it is hazardous, but manageably so - never leave the setup unattended. especially if no food in oil, monitor thermometer closely. always have something made of metal (nothing else) in reach that can cover the pot. always assume something can boil over. keep clutter away from your work area. use really high-heat oil - peanut, refined safflower, soy, rice bran; not some unspecified compound oil with a 180°C warning. be especially careful with induction, can heat a pot with small amounts of liquid in them alarmingly quick. keep the lid off as long as you are heating. if working on gas, ask someone who has experience in doing so for additional advice (overboiling into the burner is an obvious danger!), i'm electric... *the small ones that are partially plastic in construction - never managed to set a grease fire, but I think I would be far more at a loss to control one with these things than in a pot... </RelAText>

        <RelAText>I've used two different home-kitchen deep fryers over the last 18 years or so; one of them was essentially a kettle with a hidden heating element, and the other has a removable heating element that sits under the frying basket. The early one I used, the type with the hidden heating element, really has no minimum other than the basic rule-of-thumb that want at least 3x-4x the volume of oil to food being cooked, so that the oil doesn't cool down too quickly. The basket was the other factor, but if I remember correctly, my basket got pretty close to the bottom of the pan, so that wasn't a major consideration. A more serious model that I now use, which has a feature for filtering/draining oil, a more convincing thermostat, and electronic timers, has some more serious constraints, notably a minimum oil content of about 2.5 liters, and a maximum of maybe a tad over three liters. The minimum is pretty simple to explain: If you use less than 2.5 liters, none of the food will have enough room to float above the basket. You probably won't even cover the heating element without at least a liter of oil in there. Not covering the heating element has some serious consequences, namely the risk of the element glowing and eventually over-heating (based on the thermostat probe placement), oil spatter, and the more practical one of not being able to use the basket. The maximum fill line is an approximation designed to reduce the risk of oil boil-over. Having dealt with a oil boil-over on a friteuse meant for stovetop use in my starving student days in Germany, I can tell you the consequences are unpleasant. I had scars to prove it. High water content in some foods leads to furious bubbling, and if those bubbles manage to carry oil over the side of the pan, bad things happen. </RelAText>

          <RelACText>That was my thought, too -- I've seen way too many fryers where the basket stays an inch or two above the bottom, so a good deal of the oil is more heat-sync than actually coming into contact w/ the food.</RelACText>

        <RelAText>The whole point of deep frying is to use large amounts of oil. You don't want to just coat the food. You really need to have the food swim in a mass of oil much larger than the mass of the food. Else the food will cool down the oil locally and you won't get the desired crust.  So no, as long as you are using a large basket (which holds a large amount of food), you can't do proper deep frying with a small amount of oil. A consumer style deep fryer is probably already on the low side of the correct oil/food ratio.  </RelAText>

        <RelQBody>I have a favorite tried  true recipe that I simply call ‘foil potatoes’.  recipe link: http://www.evernote.com/shard/s1/sh/048c56cc-1481-48b2-89e6-88e897da651a/b0c036a6448b07e0a486f77acf2111cb This has been made multiple times with consistently good results. A few weeks ago I decided to try substituting the same quantity of home-made  greek-style yogurt in place of the whipping cream. They did not tenderize at all and although being fully cooked, were ‘crunchy’ and not desireable. As an experiment yesterday, I did another batch with part of it done with the original recipe using whipping cream,,  the rest with yogurt. All packets were done on the same grill side-by side with exactly the same time  temp. The packets with whipping cream were done perfectly  again the ones with yogurt were tough. My internet searches have not found any answers as to why this happened. In addition to wanting to understand the science of this difference, can anyone suggest changes I can make to have this substitution work? </RelQBody>

        <RelCText>Without seeing the recipe (permissions issue - it is not a public doc) it is hard to know if something else is going on, but at a minimum, the water content in cream is significantly higher than in Greek-style (strained) yogurt. I suspect that a non-strained yogurt would probably have a similar result to your cream version. You can also &quot;reconstitute&quot; strained yogurt by mixing water or milk in to give it a thinner texture which would also probably work. I doubt it is a chemical reaction, but the recipe would help.</RelCText>

        <RelAText>The amount of grease the meat exudes is dependent upon the amount of fat in the beef. If your beef is lean (10% fat), you will not likely notice a difference in the greasiness in the final product by not straining. If your meat is fatty (ground beef in the US can contain up to 30% fat), then the final product will have noticeable grease. The fat contributes in a good way (IMO) to the flavor and mouth-feel of chili if the meat is in the 15% range.  </RelAText>

        <RelCText>Have to suspect something about your cooking practices contributes to any issues you are having with PTFE. I did finally replace my 20 year old frying pan with a new one a few years back (as much for the new, thicker aluminum part as for a new cooking surface.) I don't use the PTFE for high-heat applications it's unsuited to, and I use non-metallic utensils appropriate for not scratching up the surface. OTOH, the iron skillet I went off to college with is still going strong, but I use them for different things...</RelCText>

        <RelCText>Possibly, I have changed a few things over time. When I brown meat for the slow cooker, I now use cast iron. I've warped a few aluminum non sticks doing this because I add water to the pan to get the browning out to add to the roast. Other than that it seems that most frying pans just wont stay flat and tend to shed their coatings withing 5 or 6 years.</RelCText>

        <RelAText>Use maple sugar.  Things will taste better*, but cost more. *unless, of course, you are a person who does not like real maple (of whom there are a surprising number, though I cannot claim to understand that.) For ice cream/sorbet/gelato/frozen desserts, most &quot;sugar substitutes&quot; (low calorie sweeteners, etc) don't really work, as sugar plays an important structural role in how ice cream turns out. Being sugar, maple sugar (or other &quot;unrefined/less refined&quot; sugars) work fine. </RelAText>

        <RelAText>I find that the chemical and mechanical reactions between egg-white, egg-yolk and sugar is quite an delicate and complex one. I find that there is even a difference in using white refined cane sugar and white refined beet sugars when baking and the amount of effort of creaming eggs and sugar. Sugar substitutes that claim that they &quot;behave&quot; the same as sugar also don't seem to react in a manner that you'd expect. I would suggest that you try a range of sugars... The worse of them seems to be corn based sugars. The eggs just don't behave at all... </RelAText>

        <RelQSubject>Flavor in avocadoes gone forever?</RelQSubject>
        <RelQBody>I got some made-in-store supermarket guacamole yesterday and it was a new low in bland, watery, flavorless avocado meat. I have read that the reason modern avocadoes taste bland is because they use a variety called a &quot;Hass&quot; avocado that growers prefer because it is resistant to some kinds of blight and it does not spoil as readily as other varieties. Nevertheless, as someone who remembers as a boy getting avocadoes that tasted like, well, avocadoes and actually having good guacamole, it is really discouraging the world takeover of this tasteless drone avocado called the Hass. Also, it seems the Hass itself seems to be getting more bland and more watery year by year. Is there any way to get good avocado varieties of the old type that actually taste good, or have they gone the way of the Dodo? (I should mention that I grew up in San Diego, but now live in Massachusetts so this might be part of the problem; good avocadoes might only be available locally in Southern California.) Update By some further research I have found that apparently large numbers of avocadoes are being exported by Peru, and even though they are Hass avocadoes they are reputedly MUCH more bland than California avocadoes, but also much cheaper. So, this might be the problem, I am getting Peruvian avocadoes. </RelQBody>

        <RelCText>CA is in the midst of a drought. Haven't seen a good avocado from there all year. However, before the local Mexican market burned down, they were getting *Mexican grown avocados* the size of softballs that'd make your mouth water for more; cheap too! Look to the ethnic stores, you may get lucky.</RelCText>

        <RelCText>Good tropical fruit in Massachusetts is a rarity on all fronts. Picked underripe and shipped long distances does not ever compare well with picked at/near ripe from the farm up the road. Sometimes we see halfway decent Mexican or Florida avocados. Halfway decent is about as good as it gets.</RelCText>

        <RelAText>You're exactly right in figuring out that part of the problem is having grown up with some of the world's best avocadoes, and then moving up North where decent avocadoes are scarce!  :)  Tasty avocadoes aren't all going the way of the dodo just yet, but you might have to move to Texas or Florida, or check some Mexican markets in your area, to get better avocadoes.  My husband lived in S Calif. as a child. He is an avocado connoisseur like you, as a result. Some of the best S Cali avocadoes are 'Fuerte' variety, which is more flavorful and creamier than Hass. We live in Texas and we get some very good, tasty Mexican avocadoes here- which by the way, are Hass.  But every single avocado I've brought home to hubby, whether from Mexico, Chile, Florida, Arizona, the Caribbean, Hawaii, Guatemala or Peru, ends up being compared unfavorably to those great S Calif. avocados he remembers. We visited a relative in the S Calif. area about 4.5 years ago and hubby had a delicious, fresh S Cali 'Fuerte' variety avocado during that trip--an avocado which he still recalls most fondly.  Personally I tried that same S Cali 'Fuerte' avocado too on that trip and while it was a bit tastier than the Hass avocadoes we currently get in Texas, I didn't find the flavor all THAT much better!  But hubby did prefer it a lot; he likes what he was raised on. Also his palate is more sensitive to bitterness than mine and 'Fuerte' is less bitter than Hass. In recent years, Calif. drought has made the delicious Cali avocadoes, especially the 'Fuerte', nearly impossible to get.  By the way- I lived in Illinois for a while. That state has the same avocado problem as Massachusetts: too far away from where good avocadoes and other tropical fruits are grown, to get avocadoes with decent quality. Whatever does survive the shipping journey that far North is usually picked much too green. Around the holidays such as Christmas and 16 de Septiembre and 5 de Mayo etc., there was ONE Mexican food store in Chicago that got some fresh, air-flown ripe Mexican avocadoes for sale just for these special days..at $5 each!   Mom who was raised in Texas was desperate for a good avocado because they are almost nonexistent in Chicago, so she bought 2 of those $5 avocados for Christmas dinner and said it was worth it. I had a small taste in my salad, it was great but geez $5 a piece LOL! I'm real glad we left Chicago and moved to Texas soon after that! I wouldn't count on S. California's avocado crop doing well anytime in the near future, as that area is likely to only have worse and worse water shortages and drought problems as time goes forward.  So perhaps, sadly, the 'Fuerte' avocadoes and the other delicious S Cali avocadoes you were raised on are going the way of the dodo. I hope not because they are very good avocadoes and it's always nice to be able to get USA grown tropical fruits. But unless some amazing advances in water and climate management are made to save the Cali avocado farms from extinction, your delicious S Cali grown avocadoes may become nothing more than a fond memory. </RelAText>
