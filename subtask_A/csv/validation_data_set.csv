Even going to the Fruit and Vegetable Market; where in any case; it is much better if you have company with you; not because people stare; but they are used to dealing with men as mostly on Friday the men do the shopping. Wherever you go; if they recognise you are foreigner;(because you are different) they will look at you and the inflation will rise 200% in every shop (at least they will try). Qatar is no different than any other country but a lot more safe if you behave naturally you will not be molested. One thing more - on the streets it is very much a mans' world and your will see relatively few women going alone shopping; so for many people this is really strange.

Q300_R54,Q300_R54_C5,Hi all. I finished my medical exam here in Doha. I would like to know besides HIV and TB; is there any other disease checked in the medical examination? Im only interested in the diseases that will make me fail the exam. And how many days or weeks will the result will be available? Thanks,Once you are done w/ ur medical exam you can check w/ the medical commission at least after 3 working days. Just show your receipt number or passport copy at the male counter section and you'll get to know if its ready or not. For a medical employees it usually takes about 2 wks to have the results done due to other test (e.i. creatinine test) that has to be sent to HMC for investigations. In your case; you are only required to undergo blood test(HIV) & Chest X-ray(PTB); so i think it wont take long that much. Dont you have mandoop/representative for your company? he is supposed to follow up all these things and you can always check w/ him. Good Luck!,Good

Q304_R26,Q304_R26_C7,i am a chinese girl now working in shanghai for an American website:www.smarter.com i just graduated from university majoring in english;working in different country is my dream;can someone give me advice what job i can do in Doha;and is it hard to live in the city? are there some good websites for applying a job in Doha? thank you for your time!!,Lots of jobs.... Salaries in the same field vary a lot with nationality. Qatar taxes income by housing rent (50% mininum) so if you manage to get a job make sure the company houses you or at least pays you the amount of your rent (even if it increases). You will need QR 1000 for food & other expenses if single. Anything above that you can save; depending on how much you want to save. I would say the minimum one should ask for should be QR 2000 above the Rent; else you would be really wasting your time and youth. Although there are Construction workers who work for QR700 which would be roughly what they earn in their own countries.(SriLankans & Nepalis mostly come here to get away from the civil war in their countries so they are willing to work for so low.) Qatar is booming in 2 sectors Oil/Gas and Construction. 1st is Nationalised so you may find it difficult to get into. The second is not a boom its a BLAST. Theres always jobs in Construction Companies. All other services are growing.....,Good

Even if your current job position you are making more then $6300; the chances of saving anything are highly unlikely.

Thanks; Fitri,Hi Fitri. i am from India and have come in to Doha 8 days back. The delay in the process is only at the level of the directore I'm told. Apparently once the goods arrive in Doha; the local agent contacts customs and sets a date with them to inspect the goods. This takes up to a week. after customs goes through ALL items; they give their estimate and clearance. There is a tax of 5% on the goods being brought in levied. However household goods are exempted from the tax and the agent applied to the directorate for exeption. This is where takes time and I'm told can take upto 20 / 25 days to gte the clearance. Thus the option seems to be to either pay 5% of the valuation they have done or wait.,Good

I will appreciate if any can help me.

Q296_R50,Q296_R50_C4,I know it's a ways off; but I would love to hear how people in Qatar celebrate the holiday. I imagine it's more fun here than in the U.S. for example; because Qatar is a Muslim country. Does anyone have special traditions to commemorate the end of Ramadan? I would like to profile some responders in a magazine I write for. Let me know asap! Thanks :),Oh Oryx; you are so right! Ramadan should be a month of less (material things) and more (spirituality). For a lot it is. Our schedules do not change much (eg. we do not eat all night which negates the point of fasting in my opinion). We break our fast at sunset with a small light meal. Then we have dinner in the evening. We get up before dawn for a small breakfast. We try to be better Muslims in this month...in the hope we can carry this on throughout the year. I do see Qatar changing from when I was a child during Ramadan. This is something to do with us; of course; and also the influx of expats. _______________________________________________________ Love is the answer...,Good

Q292_R44,Q292_R44_C4,Hello All; We are moving to Qatar in August. Need advice on sending 2 separate household goods shipments. Any comments on that? What are the documents required to send a shipment; what is required to receive a shipment. Any information on household shipments and regulations would be appreciated. Thanks; Fitri,I believe that the shipping company in the states coordinated with one of the local moving companies and handled most of the paperwork. When our shipment arrived we simply had to find the moving company here and give them a map on where to deliver the goods. There may have been other steps handled by my wife or her company; but it seemed fairly straightforward. Your employer and/or moving company should give adequate instructions. Be aware that they may quarantine and return later anything that they think needs to be reviewed for content; like DVD's; VHS tapes; books; CDs etc. It seems our labeling of boxes helped them in this effort and so some of our DVDs that were in the labeled boxes arrived after quarantine while others that were just haphazardly packed were delivered on the first shipment. http://www.xanga.com/BBetz,PotentiallyUseful

I have been offered 8500 QAR per month; which is around £1400 per month. This is a huge pay cut for me. After my UK expenses I'm left with just over £200 of 1500 QAR per month.

What do you mums do all day to keep them occupied? Is it better to leave to Europe in the summer?Thanks so much,Hi Papu21; Doha is quite a safe city. When we shifted from UK to Doha; we already knew that this place is generally very safe for families. To answer your question; yes a compound villa should be plenty safe. Crime is very very low in Qatar. We have fire extinguishers & smoke alarms in our rented villa; if you are worried about fires. Re health; we had a good experience with the general children's hospital when our child was sick. Lots of concerned doctors; all tests done to ensure nothing was missed and lots of consultations with other doctors to ensure proper medication and treatment was given. Most social activities happen in the evenings when weather is cooler.

Q273_R33,Q273_R33_C9,Is there a carseat law in Qatar. Is there a selection of carseats to buy in Doha?,Hi; I'm new to this forum. I feel very passionately about this topic. I have a 19 month old son and am very anal when it comes to car seats. Malaysia (where I come from) does not have car seat laws in place but I still make sure that my son travels in a car seat ; even if it's to the nearby shops. There are many available for purchase in Malaysia but the price is far too expensive for the majority. A decent car seat could set some back two months wages. So I guess even if they are aware of the need for child car seats it is out of their reach and I guess they have other prioritoes like buying food to stay alive and having a roof over thier head. Plus families in Malaysia can have as many as 4 (quite common) up to 14 children. Imagine the logistical nightmare of moving the family members around! .

Q283_R9,Q283_R9_C4,I AM WORKING IN QATAR ON LAST 6 YEARS; MY PRESENT SALARY 5000 QR; I WOULD LIKE TO RESIGN FROM MY JOB AND SETTLE BACK TO MY NATIV COUNTRY; CAN U PLEASE ADVISE ME WHAT KIND OF BENEFITS I CAN EXPECT ACCORDING TO QATAR LABOR LAW. (IS IT COMPANY CAN GIVE THE GRATUITY TOGETHER WITH MONTHLY SALARY IS IT ALLOW BY THE LAW HERE) IF I GO LEGAL ACTION AGAINST COMPANY ANY USE?? PLEASE ADVISE,every company is liable to give 21 days annual vacation and 21 days indemnity/gratuity minimum upon completion of one year. some companies to avoid this terminate the staff in 11 months. and others mostly dont pay anything to the ignorant labors and junior staff that they dont get their rights. you can approach the Human rights department and the labor department who help the expat in such cases. @ cupid-s_victim: any resignation or termination should serve a months notice except if you are terminated in your probation period (first 6 months usually). Also employees who have completed 5 years or more need to serve 2 months notice. the company is liable to pay only the notice period; the pending vacation balance if any and the indemnity calculated on the last earned basic salary. hope this helps,Good

If they don't have the specific for persians; they'll probably order it for you. I think their website is www.dohavets.com or something like that. If I may suggest; if you use an enclosed litter box; bring one with you; as they are very expensive here (QR250 for a really cheap looking one). Also bring toys; they are not easy to find here. And stuff like nail clipper as well. Oh; and frontline is also quite expensive here; and I haven't found the specific one for cats; the vet told me to simply put less of the dog one.

Q296_R50,Q296_R50_C5,I know it's a ways off; but I would love to hear how people in Qatar celebrate the holiday. I imagine it's more fun here than in the U.S. for example; because Qatar is a Muslim country. Does anyone have special traditions to commemorate the end of Ramadan? I would like to profile some responders in a magazine I write for. Let me know asap! Thanks :),We tend to do a bit of baking prior to Eid. Usually the night before (or earlier if you're really organised) we gather the kids around and make some biscuits and traditional sweets. These are then ready to distribute during the Eid prayer and also to the neighbours. They are also really handy when people come to visit you during Eid. What I've noticed here in Qatar is that friends and neighbours seem to visit each other a lot more on Eid than back home. I guess it's because we don't have family here; so our friends tend to become our new support structure. On the 2 Eids that I've so far spent in Qatar our 'new' tradition seems to be going to City Centre and getting some good sale items! LOL I guess that's our variation on spending the day at the park (too hot) or visiting the grandparents (too far) or staying at home (too boring).,Good

Any help will be greatly appreciated; as I need to make a choice if I want to go India. I hope you all will help me regarding this matter.,Hamad Medical Corporation (HMC) is the best place in Qatar to give birth; no qualms whatsoever. I read a few points mentioned earlier about sharing the room with 3 other ladies; that's true. But this is only if you are willing to pay QR100/- per day. HMC has a dedicated floor for VIPs that could be booked in advance; only that you would be required to pay about QR800/- per day. These are large rooms with good carpets and furniture for only one patient each and it even has a nice luxurious touch to it plus a good living area with sofas for seating/waiting of male guests and kids. This should be a good option; most people (expats) are not aware of this. By the way; there is a huge demand for these rooms. In terms of the medical care you can expect from HMC; I can tell you without doubts that they are very good and its amongst the best in the world. Its true that there could be individual issues at HMC faced by people and no one can guarantee you that you won't face issues. But I am sure .....,Good

Q60_R42,Q60_R42_C4,Hello All; We are moving to Qatar in August. Need advice on sending 2 separate household goods shipments. Any comments on that? What are the documents required to send a shipment; what is required to receive a shipment. Any information on household shipments and regulations would be appreciated. Thanks; Fitri,I believe that the shipping company in the states coordinated with one of the local moving companies and handled most of the paperwork. When our shipment arrived we simply had to find the moving company here and give them a map on where to deliver the goods. There may have been other steps handled by my wife or her company; but it seemed fairly straightforward. Your employer and/or moving company should give adequate instructions. Be aware that they may quarantine and return later anything that they think needs to be reviewed for content; like DVD's; VHS tapes; books; CDs etc. It seems our labeling of boxes helped them in this effort and so some of our DVDs that were in the labeled boxes arrived after quarantine while others that were just haphazardly packed were delivered on the first shipment. http://www.xanga.com/BBetz,Good

Q101_R3,Q101_R3_C9,I resigned from my job in Dubai and decided to accept an offer in Qatar. My sponsor informed me that I have to get my degree certificates attested in Qatar embassy. I inquired in Qatar embassy UAE but I was given two options. I can have it attested in Qatar embassy Philippines or Qatar. Do I need to have my degree certificates attested first to apply for my entry visa to Qatar?,it is not required to have your documents to be attested first in home country to be here in Qatar. I came here in Qatar with approved entry visa without attesting my docs. Unfortunately; after few months my employer decided to apply for us an Urban Planning & CDD Engineering Cert application; and so it is required that my docs should be attested both from my country of origin and here in Qatar. Its very costly unlike you process these things before you arrive here in Qatar.,Good
Q2_R20,Q2_R20_C4,Hi all need your help/advice we'll be in Qatar next week; me on a working visa and tourist visa for my family (wife son;daughter). My query is can I convert their tourist visa to family visit visa even I dont have yet a Qatar ID? My profession in visa is Civil Engineer. Thanks in advance..,Hi Peylenzkie. If my info is not mistaken; you have to apply for RP 1st which takes 10 days or more; then after that; you need to apply your 1 wife to 1 year Family Visit Visa (spouse) which takes 10 days; then convert her Tourist visa to Family Visit Visa (needs Attested Marriage certificate) which takes 3 days. Then lastly; apply for her RP (10 days). So my advice; finish your RP first then apply for their RP later. Tourist visa is 30 days only; not extendable so they have to go out the country.,Good

After 7 days; but only up to obtaining your Residency Permit; you can drive using a Qatari temporary license or an International driving license. After getting your RP; you will need to convert it to Qatari permanent driving license either by direct conversion (from some countries) or sitting through the test.

Q116_R41,Q116_R41_C1,hey guys. I`m a nurse here in the phils. i just signed a contract for hamad as a staff nurse. the offer is 5600 qatar riyals per month plus 1000 qatar riyal for transportation allowance. Is that a great deal? how about the free accommodation does it look good? I`m anxious about my new job. help pls.,Regarding the starting salary;if it is your 1st stint to work as nurse overseas; that looks to be fair.with regard to the transportation allowance of QR1;000/month it seem to be reasonable only if your accomodation and the hospital are located in the same city. i mean if you will be assigned in Al Khor or somewhere far and your accomodation is in Doha; then that might need to be adjusted. Hamad provide pretty decent housing or the other staff gets housing allowance. I am not a nurse but I know some nurse working with Hamad. Hamad is a government Hospital and in general they give higher salary than the private clinics/hospitals. Can you provide me Hamad's Agency and contact address in the Philippines as it could also be an option for my nurse daughter in the future. She just passed the nursing board exam and barely starting her 1st job this month.,Good

Q152_R67,Q152_R67_C6,I have my papers under process for evaluation at SCH; and the result was as follows: evaluation pending; sit for exam; I have scheduled my exam on the 31st of may here in the Philippines; BUT I only have 2 yrs experience; If I pass the prometric exam; is there a chance for me to pass the evaluation asl well? Thank you.,Supreme Council of Health also dont know if you can pass either the evaluation or the exam.

Q54_R12,Q54_R12_C8,I've been offered a job in Qatar. The money seems great. Is the standard of living; cost of living the smae compared to Dubai? What about night life - Can 1 go out and have fun like in Dubai? Is their open beaches and park to chill and relax? What about living arrangements - Can I bring my fiance; whom I'll wed in December 2008 - Can we stay together? Please somebody - Help me decide. Brendan,Cost of living is less because there's generally less entertainment and stuff to spend on. Rent is crazy expensive. Night life is nothing compared to Dubai's; there are a few bars and no proper clubs; every once in a blue moon there's a party held at one of the hotels. As for ur fiance; she can come here but not on ur sponsorship; she can come on a tourist visa and keep renewing it until u get married and then u can get her the RP on ur sponsorship or she would have to have a job her ready before u guys come so that her company would sponsor her.

Try to find an Expat leaving town. Lease for a month; learn to drive here in somebody elses car; see what you can find and then buy.,PotentiallyUseful

Q12_R26,Q12_R26_C7,Hi everybody; I'm moving to Qatar in the Summer as my Husband starts a job with Qatar Airways. I'm frantically trying to secure a school place which isn't easy. Does anybody know much about Newton British School or Sherborne ? or any good school that i will be able to get a place for; reception; year 2; year 3 for September. Any help will be greatly received; Many thanks Sarah XX,Sherborne has a better reputation amongst parents as having better facilities and teachers; but as said above it's new and so doesn't have as long a history to create complaining parents. There have been a number of debates about Newton on QL but the consensus is that Sherborne a quality option. I know parents who have had children at both; but; to be honest; the parents with children at Newton have pulled their children out to place them elsewhere--they cited poor management primarily but were not happy with their teachers either. The Sherborne parents remain happy with their choice. Either way; I would suggest putting your children on the wait lists for places like DESS and Doha College; which are the best British-curriculum schools in the city (but with waiting lists to match). If you plan to be in Doha for a while; its worth the year-long wait to get in. If by that time you've fallen in love with the school your children are in; then nothing is lost.,Good

Q11_R31,Q11_R31_C8,I just want to ask when start of EID?,Insha' Allaah it may be on 7th November Since the Islamic calendar is purely lunar; as opposed to solar or luni-solar; the Muslim (Hijri) year is shorter than the Gregorian year by about 11 days; and months in the Islamic (Hijri) year are not related to seasons; which are fundamentally determined by the solar cycle. This means that important Muslim festivals; which always fall in the same Hijri month; may occur in different seasons. For example; the Hajj and RamDHaan can take place in the summer as well as the winter. It is only over a 33 year cycle that lunar months take a complete turn and fall during the same season.,Good

Is there anyway I can obtain a personal loan in Qatar before I leave the UAE; so that i can settle my finances her before I leave? Any advise from anyone in a similar situation? Thanks,Nope you can't unless you can do the following : Talk to your bank and inform them about your situation; they will advise you to do the following: first you need to have a job offer in Qatar; if you have a job offer; then you need to stamp the offer ( certain attestation) and the contract from the Ministry of foreign affairs and then from the Qatari Embassy in UAE. Afterwards; the bank would need a standing order also stamped from certain authorities guaranteeing that you will be transferring the loan amount every month from your job salary in Qatar. After all that; you submit these documents to the bank for their approval. ( they will approve it if all documents are attested). Good luck :),Good

Thomas,Thomas; Some of the newer apartment compounds have gyms in them. I've seen a very nice gym setup in a compound off of Salwa. I haven't been to Gold's Gym on D-Ring; but I understand that you can get 10 single day passes for 370 riyals (roughly $10 US per visit).

Yearly memberships can be bought for access to hotel facilities; but these may be fairly pricy too. If money is no object then looking at hotel memberships is probably where you'll find the nicest facilities. Some hotels may offer day passes so that you can check things out and compare.

Q89_R38,Q89_R38_C4,shocks when i get out of my car? Does anyone else experince this? its driving my brain!,Many people experience shocks when they get out of their car. Often they believe that the car is charged - but this is not normally so. Sitting in the car; electrostatic charges are generated on the car seat and the person's body; due to contact and movement between the clothes and the seat. When the person leaves the seat; They take half of this charge with them. As they get out of the vehicle; their body voltages rises due to this charge - a voltage of 10;000 Volts is not unusual. When they reach to touch the vehicle door; the electrostatic discharge and shock occurs as their hand approaches the metal door. The voltage build-up can often be avoided by holding onto a metal part of the door frame as you leave the seat. This provides a return dissipation path for the charge on your body. If you have forgotten to hold the metal door part as you leave the seat; a shock may often still be avoided by touching the glass window before you touch the metal door. The glass may be conductive enou.....,Good

The shop """"Skate Shack"""" on Salwa Road (on your left after the 2nd roundabout when coming from Ramada) is good but has high end bicycles - cheapest one is QR 1700 3.

Q43_R29,Q43_R29_C7,Hi everyone; my Husband has just got a Job with Qatar Airways and i'm hoping to get my three children into a British School in Doha in September 2012; i need a place in Year 3; Year 2 and Reception. can anybody advise on how likely that is ? i'm not sure if i should stay in the UK until i can get the children into a School or could that be a really long wait ??? any information would be greatly received; Many Thanks XX,My husband also works for Qatar Airways. Now is an excellent time to apply for schools here as they are sorting places for Sept 2012. I am a teacher and it was a worry trying to get our daughter into a school. We arrived at the wrong time of year and it took a while to get her into a school so I had to home teach for a while. However; this time last year we got our daughter into Doha College. She has come on in leaps and bounds and we are thrilled with the school. The school has recently been inspected and did extremely well. They use the British Curriculum so the transition from UK to Doha College was very easy! Your children will need to sit an assessment but it's nothing to worry about. You will also need previous school reports from their current UK school. Other schools that we were impressed with were DESS and Sherbourne. Hope that helps! Good luck! :),Good

Your new company might be over the slab of the nationality of your passport. So the MOI has deferred the approval for a later stage. 2. Your application might be deferred due to some missing papers but MOI has failed to update it on their portal. Kindly ask your PRO to check it with Gharaffa Immigration or else you can have the receipt and make a visit in the morning. 3. Also let me know whether you kept ur National PCC attested by Foreign affairs office or the CEID PCC from Qatar.

We had to call her from our personal mobiles. Not a very pleasant experience. I'm having all my children at Hamad Medical.,Good

Q24_R54,Q24_R54_C3,KLM have told me my Yorkshire Terrier is able to travel in the cabin with me from the U.K to Doha. Has anyone done this? 2 pet relocation companies have told me I cant and Im unsure whether they are telling me this to avoid getting their fee or whether I have been misinformed by KLM. Cost is not the issue; the wellbeing of our wonderful pet is.I really want the most stress free method of travel possible for her. Can anyone help.,Both KLM and Lufthanza allow you to bring pets from the UK (via Netherlands or Germany) in the cabin. The pet plus the carrier has to weigh under around 8kg (which should be fine for a small breed). Price is surprisingly minimal - it is a fixed excess baggage charge of around £70 (check with airlines). The pet has to be transported in a carrier which fits under the seat (really only during take off and touch down). There are special soft carriers which have a tent-like squashable roof which will fit under the seat and spring back up. The brand that springs to mind is Sturdibag. Good luck!

Q26_R26,Q26_R26_C3,Hi; I contacted a nursery teacher who was looking for a job and i offered that she work as a nanny for my kids; 8 hours daily for 5 days aweek and she asked for 2500 QR monthly. She also asked if i can give her a work visa. Is this a reasonable price? and is their a difference in the salary if she is on my sponsorship and living at my house or if she is on somebody else sponsorship and live out? please provide your advice as soon as possiple.,she is trying to rip you off. a live-in maid is paid in the range of 800-1500 these days. this lady wont be staying in and she wants you to sponsor her as well. she is crazy and you will be even more crazier to accpet her offer. what k9 said is true...but thats an altogether different issue. sometimes you got to work and leave the kids in a trusted person's care.but i would also add that there are some extremely lovely maids/nannies who take very good care of the children.it all depends upon how we treat the help and how they do in return. i suggest you contact recruiting agencies here who get the maid for you...the initial pay is high...but thats it. you can have the maid on your sponsorship and have them on trial basis too; if you are unhappy they change them for you. else just apply directly for visa and then go about hunting for the nanny/maid.in short indian embassy has kept the minimum pay for maid as 900;philipino is 1200 and indonesian is in the same figure...i think it is 800......,Good

Is it the same in Qatar? Hope not. Many thanks!,Yes there r shallow ppl; but mostly the youth. As u will be coming here to work then most of ur relations will be with ur colleagues so u may never notice the others except in the malls. So I think u will like it here.

Now; my problem is how am I goin to go back there with him? can he get me a family visa? Thanks in advance!,without government approval of your marriage; you won't get a family visa back into Qatar; unfortunately. Marrying you out of the country can cause major problems for your fiance; so I would suggest you wait until your marriage is approved. The only other option is that you relocate somewhere else; marry there; but your marriage will not be valid in Qatar; and you will have no claim to any inheritences if god forbid; something should happen to him. Does your fiance not have some Wasta; that can obtain your release from your company?

Q31_R32,Q31_R32_C3,KLM have told me my Yorkshire Terrier is able to travel in the cabin with me from the U.K to Doha. Has anyone done this? 2 pet relocation companies have told me I cant and Im unsure whether they are telling me this to avoid getting their fee or whether I have been misinformed by KLM. Cost is not the issue; the wellbeing of our wonderful pet is.I really want the most stress free method of travel possible for her. Can anyone help.,Both KLM and Lufthanza allow you to bring pets from the UK (via Netherlands or Germany) in the cabin. The pet plus the carrier has to weigh under around 8kg (which should be fine for a small breed). Price is surprisingly minimal - it is a fixed excess baggage charge of around £70 (check with airlines). The pet has to be transported in a carrier which fits under the seat (really only during take off and touch down). There are special soft carriers which have a tent-like squashable roof which will fit under the seat and spring back up. The brand that springs to mind is Sturdibag. Good luck! Btw I was told about the airlines by Doha Vets (who were amazingly helpful) and then checked directly with the airlines in the UK; who agreed with this...,Good

My query is can I convert their tourist visa to family visit visa even I dont have yet a Qatar ID? My profession in visa is Civil Engineer. Thanks in advance..,I would suggest not to bring your family unless u get ur RP done. Because 1s their tourist visa is expired and you don;t have family visa they won't be able to come back to Doha for next 3 months (explained by the Visa incharge in the company of my husband ). And your RP would take approx. 7 months as they need your salary statement for 6 months which you'll get only when you have a bank account. After you complete your 6 months salary statement from bank; you need Rent agreement; your educational certificates needs to be attested by your country embassy and Doha embassy (you can do this within those 6 months also); you need to clear fingerprints and medical tests and then you'll get your RP & QID. After that you can bring them on tourist visa on your sponsorship which can be extended for upto 6 months (as it was a year ago. Might have changed now) unless you get your family visa and their RPs & QIDs. Working out for their RPs & QIDs will be much easier than yours. All the Best.,PotentiallyUseful

Q106_R46,Q106_R46_C4,Good day all; If you're like me; and were unfortunate enough to enroll your children at Iqra English School; and endure an utterly useless academic year; I'd like to hear from you. I'd like to spread the word of caution to all unsuspecting parents of this money-grab. Thanks,If your child is in KG1 (in other words 3 years old) then you may be being slightly quick to judge both your child's 'academic' development and also the school's performance in this area. At 3 children should be learning to socialise; become curious; play; make friends; become more self-reliant and independent and have fun! Iqra Preschool helps the children do all of those important things excellently. The school does put greater emphasis on more obviously 'academic' matters when the children turn 4 and enter Reception class but the more subtle 'academic' learning the children get in Nursery class is equally important. Much science is learnt in the sand and water tray in Nursery class even if it does not look like a science lesson to the untrained eye just because it did not take place in a physics lab with reference to a 100 page book. The important question to ask yourself is if your 3 year old child enjoys coming to the school; has made friends; has expanded their vocabulary etc etc.....,Bad

Q45_R25,Q45_R25_C5,Comments anyone?,Hi; I can only give you an account of my experience...whether it is a true reflection of the school I don't know. Firstly; it's in a lovely building; but it is only a temporary base. They could give no idea when a move would be made. The school has no sports facilities I was told. Secondly; I saw no children as they wouldn't accede to my request to look around the school. The only people I saw - Admin staff - were; without exception; Lebanese. Therefore; I got the distinct impression that it is a Lebanese School. Thirdly; they took my non-refundable application fees (QR1;500 for 3 children) quite happily; and haven't offered any places - they just request more and more pointless information. I; too; will be leaving Qatar at the earliest opportunity because of these school issues. They all take non-refundable application fees; whilst knowing that they cannot offer places - it's called fraud in the real World isn't it? My advice - choose a country that can actually offer education for yo.....,Good

I hate those people who ask for commission;they taking advantage; and to greedy!;..,and unfortunately; the beast is the unregulated market in Qatar. There are now MANY landlords who are refusing to pay any commission to agents; and this has therefore led almost EVERY main agency in Qatar to start charging tenants. In THEORY; they should provide you with a great; professional service; though admittedly this is not always the case. The UAE has a regulatory body in place....but tenants pay 5% there in fees for EVERY deal! Often the service is terrible there; even with the laws in place. As has been said; it's a one off payment.

With this term coming to an end I am eager to secure a second place and currently looking elsewhere.

We need advice/recommendations on the following: - International hospitals for the birth? Which hospitals would you suggest? - What are the levels of care? - Are fathers permitted to be at the birth? Thanks so much for your time. David,Hi David; I gave birth here two months ago. I'm from NZ. If this is you and your wife’s first baby then I would recommend you have the baby back home. There is no advice or antenatal classes in Doha. It was not such a great experience for me and I relied a lot on emailing family and friends back home for advise. My husband and I have decided to have our next baby back home so we don’t go through what we went through here. Also do not go to Doha Clinic. Our experience there was traumatic. If you want more information about it I will be happy to explain. We have made an official complaint to the hospital but they don't give a hoot. There is no after care for babies in Doha at any hospital but the best one if you have to go to one is Ali Ahli. They are a new hospital and are quite good.

Q189_R2,Q189_R2_C8,Hi; I am interested to migrate to Canada. Appreciate if any one can recomend me a good migration consultants in Qatar. Is it advisable to process my application through them ? or can I do it on my own. Thanks a Lot.,As some of you have suggested; to apply for permanent residency in Canada is pretty straight forward o majority of the cases.  The Green Card is only referring to permanent resident of the States; not Canada.  Also; the color of the card for permanent resident card has been changed to white color many yaers ago though most people still refer to green card. To qualify for Canadian permanent resident visa; you  need to accumulate a total of 67 points (used to be 75 points) which are based on your age; education level; profession; employment status; english proficiency; suitability; and among others.  Just go to the official canadian immigration website as stated above and u will get all the info.  God luck~!,Good

I am also sponsored by my company separate from my husband's. Can I switch my Husband's sponsorship from his company to mine so that he can leave his current job and pursue something else? We thought this may be a work around to the situation he is in. Thanks,I am an UK national and have a great position and great pay; thus i don't believe that will be a problem.

I know people who came on wife's sponsorship and looked for a job and transferred thier sponsorship to thier new employers once they got a job. But that person did not have a job or previous sponsorship. Our case is different; cause he has a current sponsorship. Only reason why we want to switch is so that he can have some freedom to choose.

Q31_R22,Q31_R22_C5,Ok guys I am going to prehaps ticks someone off again but I have a question; not Sunny but me. Will a Qatari man go out with a western Christian girl; have sex with her and then move on because he think women from the west are wild and sex craved. Sunny has received quite a bit response from Qatari men who want to date her once we arrive; I even got an offer myself. But I believe it is a trap and I tell Sunny be careful. Any advice out there?,Sadly this has been the case for many years. Maybe it originally stems from the days when arabs had loads of money; visited capital cities (mainly in the West) and were naturally surrounded (as they were rich) by hookers. Word spread when they returned that they had been with western women. The assumption would then be made that all Western women were loose. That is the assumption that we came to many years ago. Rather like the Western men going to Thailand,Good

I looked at a place on the Pearl in Sabban Towers; which will be the first completed tower on the pearl.

Property prices are rising roughly 10% per month at the moment and trust me that is not going to slow down in a hurry. They just will never beable to build fast enough to catch up with the demand as has happened in Dubai. I definitely think it is a good invetsment; even if the appreciation on the property slows down to 10% per annum that is still a good investment when you condsider the fact that you are currently just pouring your rent money into someone else's pocket or mortgage and you could be putting that into your on property which you can redeem when you sell the place.

As far as quality acoustic guitars here in Doha; there is basically nothing to speak of. Modern home has a very basic Yamaha (although I had heard they were going to expand); but the Souq selection is woeful. Al Badie is quite good for gear and amps; some string; but nothing really for acoustic.

Zak's is primarily electric (Fender; Ibanez so on) but they have some nice Fender; Yamaha and Guild acoustic guitars too.

I think we are all lucky and should be thankful that we're paid really well when compared to these guys. I know few would argue that we are educated and we deserve to be where we are. But little generosity won't affect us much. 1. The guy that pushes the shopping trolley for you A: I PUSH MY OWN TROLLEY; IF SOMEONE DOES HELP ME I PAY QR. 2/- PER TROLLEY. 2.

Q97_R13,Q97_R13_C4,I am new lady driver and today is my first drive from home to office.

Am I gonna get fine QR6000 for this ??? Please your kind advise if you ever had this experience. Thank you so much. Nervous Mom,Traffic rules 101 - Red means to STOP ... So; If you've crossed the lights while anything but red; you are good. Some people are extra cautious and stop when the green starts to blink (that is just a personal choice) because the fines are just too hefty. But they risk getting rammed from the behind if they brake suddenly. You can pass through even on amber; but it is just not worth taking that risk. Best is to always reduce speed while approaching the lights.,Good

Q183_R40,Q183_R40_C6,Hello. Does anybody know the requirements for a Philippine citizen to get a Qatar Tourist Visa if the host will be the one to finance the trip? Do I need affidavit of support and the host's bank statement to present to the consul? I am planning to visit my fiance currently deployed in Qatar and he will be the one to sponsor the trip and the visa process. I will stay there for a week if ever granted a Qatar tourist visa. Any ideas please? Thanks.,h! dear As far as i know you can easily get a tourist visa easily but the difficult part is entering/passing Philippine immigration. I would suggest to ask someone from qatar to play as sponsor in behalf of ur fiancee; much better if its a woman bcoz Qatar culture doesn't tolerate such things that a guy will sponsor a girl without any immediate relation. in addition to; the Phil. immigration might ask u for additional docs like sponsor letter; bank statement; show money; married cert if your married etc. just to satisfy them that ur genuine visitor in the country.

Q158_R74,Q158_R74_C7,is minoxidil hair loss treatment effective for men??? if so.then what is the most effective treatment for hair loss??,Get checked out at the doctor; if you have too much Testosterone this is a side effect (hence 'male pattern baldness' in the over 30's). The other contributing factor is diet; eating properly is important; a balanced diet without junk food which contains 'empty calories' in other words lots of calories but no vitamins or minerals. Don't waste money and valuable time on pills and potions sort out the cause not the effect. Its like waxing your car when the engine has no oil in it; it doesn't help; wastes time and money (and the engine still seizes),PotentiallyUseful

Q39_R6,Q39_R6_C1,Ok guys I am going to prehaps ticks someone off again but I have a question; not Sunny but me. Will a Qatari man go out with a western Christian girl; have sex with her and then move on because he think women from the west are wild and sex craved. Sunny has received quite a bit response from Qatari men who want to date her once we arrive; I even got an offer myself. But I believe it is a trap and I tell Sunny be careful. Any advice out there?,It is a very rare Qatari man that would want anything more than what you just described. It is a very rare man in Qatar that wants anything more to do with a Western girl than you just described. Meeting men here is like stepping through a minefield. 9 out of 10 of them just want sex. And they will do and say anything to get it from you. I am not bitter; I do not hate men; but I have been living in various parts of Asia for the last 2 and a half years. Trust me when I say if you do not want to get burned be VERY careful who you date. Asian opinion of Western women is not very high when it comes to sex and dating. Tell Sunny to stop advertising online for a date and come here and get the lay of the land first.,Good

Q106_R46,Q106_R46_C6,Good day all; If you're like me; and were unfortunate enough to enroll your children at Iqra English School; and endure an utterly useless academic year; I'd like to hear from you. I'd like to spread the word of caution to all unsuspecting parents of this money-grab. Thanks,If your 3 year old child was attending a school in the UK he/she would be doing the same things described by Badawia (and I presume this is what is taught at Iqra). These are skills that help children think creatively and independently. Both of these skills are essential for higher forms of learning and applying expertise in later life. If a child is simply taught the skill to memorise and regurgitate then he/she will not get far in later life. Unfortunately; too many schools in Doha view this type of structured learning as progress. That is why Qatar is so reliant on expertise from outside.,Bad

Q177_R67,Q177_R67_C3,Qtel offers 512k; 1MB; and 2MB ADSL for 200;300; or 400QR per month. I am moving to a place where I will have to decide which subscription.

Q177_R35,Q177_R35_C5,Hi everyone; in a few weeks I am about to start working for Qatar Airways as a cabin crew. Does anyone know what is the avarage flying time a month for a cabin crew? does it vary for those who just started working than for those who work for QR for some time? If you get a 3 year contract is it possible to get some promotion after a year or two or you just have to work on the same position and for the same salary for those 3 years? Thanks in advance.,Where ever you go ; what ever you do...Just give in you 100%. They will definately recognize your hard work and commitment. I have personally seen crew getting promoted based on their effort and trust me these people had no flying experience earlier and neither did they know any one in the top managment.Its the hard work.Flying hours are normally as per standards. Once in a while you might get less rest but its not impossible or to hectic to manage that kinda roster. More over you are provided with amazing accomodation; good perks.Its a good company to start. QA is one of most reputed airlines today. So if you pass here you can pass anywhere. Every coins have 2 sides; good and bad. You can choose on what you would like to concentrate. So do not listen to fellow crew; work hard; prove your self and you see the results Be patient and commit your self to your career.,Good
Q19_R9,Q19_R9_C10,Hi Friends; Can anybody let me know how to go to Bahrain by road and how far it is? I was told by one of my friend that it is just 400kms away from Doha. Thanks for the replies in advance.,Hi; My colleague has done this trip and he had this to say. This is the instruction to drive from Bahrain to Doha. Reverse the same for Doha to Bahrain. -Its around KM. 430 one way; and it will take minimum 5 Hours including immigration stop. -First; you need to take Saudi visa and put it in the passport (which will be return visa); then you go to Qatar embassy to take Qatar visa based on Saudi Visa. -I can not say whether it is safe or not ; but you need to go during the day because there is KM. 125 stretch which is from Ehassa to Qatar border which is one way road and I think it is a little risky when you drive at night.. -Do not take a laptop with you or any private books because they check every single folder in the laptop which it will take long time ;and they will confiscates all the books that you have. I wish to know about the insurance on my car during my stay in Qatar. I intend to do this trip in this month so do let me know if anyone has done so. Hope this is of help,Good

Q127_R51,Q127_R51_C5,Hello everyone; I'm already here in Qatar a month ago under business visa with my sponsor. Do I still need an NOC in order to apply for another company here in Qatar if ever I decide to go home on the 3 month period of the business visa? Thanks.,if your current employer didn't transfer your business visa to working visa then u still had a chance to discontinue the work and exit Doha. You just need to have an exit permit from the sponsor of business visa. But if you already had a medical from your current employer then it means that they already applied the change of your visa even if the RP card is not yet given to you and you will be ban for 2 years if you exit Doha. Mostly companies here are not giving NOC; so think twice before you decide.,Good

Q172_R44,Q172_R44_C9,M.E.S started refusing admission to certain nationals back in 1998. There rationale was that students from certain background can be a disruptive influence. Critics were in peace back then. Now; it is simply ridiculous. Why refuse admission to non-Indian nationals? Is the eduction ministry aware of this? There should be tough rules and fines for this. I know of no PRIVATE schools in qatar or overseas which conduct in such non ethical fashion.,Indian schools are supposed to give priority to applicants of Indian nationality; that is the primary reason they were allowed to set up here. To provide education to Indians. All Indian schools currently are swamped with more admission requests than the capacity they have. So if they let a non-Indian national in; they would be denying another Indian student a seat; that doesn't make sense. By the way; MES is not the only school doing this and neither is this practice restricted to Indian schools. Doha College gives first priority to British. American School of Doha gives first priority to Americans. Qatar Foundation gives first priority to Qataris... So before you call someone 'anarchist'; you really should check your facts first...,Good

Granada UK has 4 year old Coronation st and Emmerdale. BBC Prime is ok; especially if you have been here a few years and missed things that were on BBC1. There is a good chance that BBC iPlayer will be available to paying interntional customers in the future so we will be able to watch all up to date tv on demand. To be honest; the tv here is not the same as the UK; old episodes of What not to Wear; Homes Under the Hammer etc with the odd drama.

Q69_R26,Q69_R26_C10,I'm sorry; I know this has been asked before a thousand times. The problem is most of the threads are 4 years old. What is the absolutely cheapest car available for rent through a reputable company? (I'm not interested in renting from anyone's friend; thanks!),Buddy; cheaper cars on rental basis are easy to find in Qatar but the car owners make very strict conditions. i had a bad experience for finding cheaper car like you on rental basis as there was a condition that if car involves in an accident and it's not my fault; i still have to pay the rent for car for the days it stays in garage. THAT'S REDICULOUS.... Big rent a cars like AVIS; BUDGET or THRIFTY etc. you don't have to worry about any thing bcz even you crash their cars; you just have to pay small amount as these cars are fully insured rather than those small rent a cars; who are just waiting for a prey (Customer) and suck all the money you have....

He is a large breed; and special restirctions are needed for us to bring him in. I wanted to check with others who have come from the UK; how your pet has adapted to life in Qatar?

BTW; I had a pair of Oakley's a few years back and the arms kept snapping. They got fixed no problem but it's no fun to have to go for a few weeks without sunnies while they get fixed.

Right; misconception clear-up time. Bottled water in many cases is just bottled tap water. Nestle's brand over here; and 'oasis' from dubai; is just bottled tapwater; nothing else. Tap water contains chemicals. Yes it does; thankfully; otherwise it wouldn't be water. It is made up of the elements hydrogen and oxygen; which are chemicals. It may also contain trace elements and a small abount of chlorine to prevent bacterial growth; boiling tap water will remove the chlorine. Bottled water is safer. Don't be too sure; Mineral water can only be classified as mineral water by the EU if it has had nothing added to it; that includes anything that will disinfect the water; which WILL contain a small bacterial culture. Secondly; read this http://www.rd.com/your-america-inspiring-people-and-stories/rethink-what-you-drink/article51807.html It's a fairly good laymans summary of standards testing and safety of bottled water.

What is acceptable?""","""As a woman here in Qatar; I encountered the same problem when I moved here last year...I was told """"long sleeves and long skirts"""". That is not entirely true; esp. in the summer when the heat is unbearable. Your wife can wear capris (knees do need to be covered) and short-sleeved tops as long as the neckline isn't too low. The benefit to long summer skirts is that they are actually cooler than pants. The general rule is that it shouldn't be too tight or two revealing. Also; keep in mind that they run the A/c on high everywhere; so your wife will probably want to keep a cardigan with her to wear around on top of short sleeves when she is in restaurants; malls; etc. You are arriving in October; so the weather will be fine; like spring weather in the States; very pleasant actually.

Is it normal to take such a long time ? Thank you for your help  ,From your comments I can see that there might be few issues. 1. Your new company might be over the slab of the nationality of your passport. So the MOI has deferred the approval for a later stage. 2. Your application might be deferred due to some missing papers but MOI has failed to update it on their portal. Kindly ask your PRO to check it with Gharaffa Immigration or else you can have the receipt and make a visit in the morning. 3. Also let me know whether you kept ur National PCC attested by Foreign affairs office or the CEID PCC from Qatar.

Q44_R64,Q44_R64_C6,Hi everybody; I'm moving to Qatar in the Summer as my Husband starts a job with Qatar Airways. I'm frantically trying to secure a school place which isn't easy. Does anybody know much about Newton British School or Sherborne ? or any good school that i will be able to get a place for; reception; year 2; year 3 for September. Any help will be greatly received; Many thanks Sarah XX,Definitely; Definitely; Definitely; Definitely Sherborne. If you do a search on QL; you find a number of complaining threads about NBS and almost all positive views of Sherborne. Sherborne is relatively new; but it is growing into secondary and has a good reputation for quality teachers and good resources. Once in Qatar; you should also have a close look at DESS; Doha College; Park House and Compass--the waiting lists are probably full for this year; but there is always the next and such thinks need to be well planned in Doha. My children are at DESS; which is primary only. A number of the parents I know of have chosen Sherborne over even Doha College for secondary; which is a good sign of its growing reputation. Good luck.,Good

Q120_R43,Q120_R43_C8,Morning All; Moving to Doha this month (May) and am looking to find a reliable care leasing company. Any recommendations? thanks,You can try Lease/Rent to Own. For example a new Honda Accord-2011 under lease-to-own will cost you approx. QR.2450/-p.m. x 48 months. (If you make any down payment; this amount will reduce accordingly) The car will be yours to keep after all the payments are made; you will bear the cost of repairs; periodic maintenance; insurance etc. It's easy to get in a couple of days time. It will work out cheaper this way rather than conventional lease to own where the company does these tasks but high charges inbuilt in monthly pricing. Our company has lease to own products so if interested send me a PM when required.,Good

Q228_R8,Q228_R8_C1,Any advice on where to buy maternity clothes? So far; the few malls I've looked has either a terrible selection (i.e. a selection of 3 different items) or the prices are out of control. I'm to the point of buying online and paying to ship. Any ideas? (Please; serious comments only; I'm in no mood for sarcastic;silly; male humor this morning...),hi Minoush; I think you probably tried these shops already; ie; mothercare;marks and spencer; BHS; Next.

Q241_R23,Q241_R23_C2,I am buying a used car from a private individual for which I am paying cash. I have done a search and am not quite finding the information I am looking for. Do I need a letter of no objection to do the transfer? I need an answer from someone who really knows for sure; not someone who is just guessing.,You'd need an NOC (No objection certificate) if your company is not a government firm. Secondly; you would not need an NOC if you're here in Qatar on your husband's sponsorship. You'd need an NOC if your company sponsored your visa even if you're married and you stay with your husband in Qatar. Hope this helps!,Good

Q266_R51,Q266_R51_C3,I am setting up my home and am thinking of trying ebay or similar sites to try to save money. I might try to list some of my things to sell as well. I am wondering about shipping and fees and so on. Does anyone have experience with this?,I use eBay in conjunction with Aramex for shipping. Some sellers on eBay will ship direct to Qatar as well. You will need to decide if it's wiser to spend the extra on shipping or perhaps buy locally. Aramex are a cost effective shipper from the states and the UK. When you join their Shop & Ship service they give you a postal address in the USA and UK. You have you items delivered to that address; and then they forward your goods to a depot here at reasonable rates. I don't think selling items on eBay is a viable option from Qatar. But somebody else may think otherwise.,Good

Sunny has received quite a bit response from Qatari men who want to date her once we arrive; I even got an offer myself. But I believe it is a trap and I tell Sunny be careful. Any advice out there?,Life is not easy if you are a Western Woman; and the main reason a man from this part of the world would want a western woman is mainly for sex. However; please do not for one moment think that the men and women here con't have premarital relationships - they do it just not talked about and it is not caried out in the open. Due to the conservative background of the boys they will always return to their families and it would be vry difficult for them to marry outside the families would not be happy about it. I think it is much better to be very cautious out here although there are a great many handsome men and they can be very charming going through the Arab and Asian world of men they are all interested in SEX. One of the things is that being found to be together whoc ae not married can get into very deep trouble here - just a little food for thought.,Good

I have been told that because the restaurants in the community are subsidised you can eat well for a couple of dollars! The school seems to have the same 'politics' issues of any school; so I guess it all depends on who you end up being mates with as to how bearable it is.

I hear that in Qatar nobody goes out on saturday; is that true? Where would you go for RnB and hiphop? And Ive heard alot about a club called Qube is it any good? Any feedback would be welcome thanks!,If you enjoy filipino cover bands and lots of asian variety in the crowd then the Qube is GREAT; however if you enjoy more of the western flair you are down to Garvey's; Rugby Club; and Rydges.

Q205_R30,Q205_R30_C4,Hiya; Does anyone have any kids in Parkhouse school that could give me a real good insight with regards to the teaching standards; etc please. Would the kids fit back into the UK system if they were to go back to UK? (sometime; lol) Any other comments appreciated. Thanks.,A number of my tuition students are from Parkhouse. There seems to be little support for those who lag behind in a particular subject. Also the number of UK qualified teachers with QTS (Qualified Teacher Status) is limited. You may wish to ask how many of the teachers actually have QTS compared to those that don't. Many of the teachers are not from the UK and do so not have a background of teaching a British Curriculum. Finally; Parkhouse only follows part of the National Curriculum of England and Wales. The rest of the curriculum is based around what is referred to as the International Curriculum; which is created by a private company in the UK and is not endorsed by the government. This topic has been discussed a number of times previously so you may wish to do a search to get a better idea of the school. You may also wish to try other UK curriculum schools such as Doha College; DESS; Sherborne and the International School of London. Good luck.,Good

For instance; 2 Civil Engineers; one from the US and one from Philippines you will find that the one from the philppines will be on say 8000QAR and maybe the one from the states will be on 21QAR (in their home country). HR will base their offer on how much extra (or not) they can get away with offering above what they currently earn. So you can't give someone who is on 8kqar currently over 20k and similarly you cannot offer someone who is on 21k less than that because he thinks; why would I want to come here for less than I am currently earning at home. Also back to BE's point; rents; mortgages general cost of living in India and Philippines is much less than it is in most of Europe and North america. And lastly for those that say why not hire all from India etc because there is nothing more detrimental to a good company than hir.....,Good

Q237_R58,Q237_R58_C5,I have just been informed by my HR department that all 'secretarial' positions now must be Qatarized. Can some one confirm this please ?,It could very well be true. Qatarization is a very high priority here. But with that said; saying that Qataris should fill secretarial positions and getting them to do so are two different things. A national is going to have to want the job before the job is Qatarized. I'm not sure how this would be handled so I don't see it happening overnight. I'm not sure if this refers to replacing people already in positions or for new positions opening up. One would like to think that expats will keep their job until their contract runs out at least. Also - it could be that a qualified Qatari is given first opportunity at a new position and if it isn't filled then it can be opened up to expats. In any event - it will take time to sort out.,PotentiallyUseful
