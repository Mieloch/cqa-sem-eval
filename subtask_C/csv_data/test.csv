Which is a good bank as per your experience in Doha,I dont know if it is the high competition or No competition Is there any review issued by Central Bank or any magazine  Is there any benchmark based on customer feedback When I searched QL there are so many disappointed and negative feedback from from bank clients I dont see the reasons behind it Regards,1
Which is a good bank as per your experience in Doha,Sheabi the reason behind it is that most people in QL have very low income hence everytime a bank will take them a penny even a very justified one for a rendered service they will call them robbersAlso bank may not have the same level of service if you earn  or  I would advise you to find a the right branch and the right customer service agent and stick to him to build a relationship Because like everywhere you got some lazy people and you want to avoid them,1

Which is a good bank as per your experience in Doha,Hi Lamea im kinda new in here but what I know about islamic banking is that they got much lower rates and a certain portion is donated to their Muslim Communities who need help  gotta think from the more positive angle since we are living in their world we gotta live by it Otherwise go to America or Europe instead but for me Islam and Islamic banking is good Just a thought No offense meant ok Cheers PETER GERARD ALEXANDER QUEMADA ALEX CALL ME  FRIENDSTER ME alexandrequemadayahoocom,1

Which is a good bank as per your experience in Doha,Fact  If your company terminates you take that letter to your bank  you wont be required to pay any remaining amount  bank will use its tacts  dont yield  after few days of delay  finally you will get clearance from bank and fly home  Insurer of your money  bank would pay that amount to bank may be insurer and bank are having offices in the same building  or managers are cousins  they are after your money  so escape clear from both parties  Pray hard  Good luck in finding another job soon somewhere  Regards,0

What is the best place now in Qatar to spend the Eid holidays,been snorkeling at dukhan off the beach and in zekreet off the kayak was ok at both places I think Fuwairit would be nice also the national park off the north coast would be good to check out sometime,1
What is the best place now in Qatar to spend the Eid holidays,Hi Guys Nice to have the locations for snorkeling Is anyone able to be more precise and give exact locations I know the time is close to be over this year due to gelly fishs Anyway please advice the best locations to snorkel Thanks in advance for your answers,0
What is the best place now in Qatar to spend the Eid holidays,I went snorkelling two days ago off the coast of Dukhan about  km to the right of the Water Sports Club near to the Desalination plant Some massive rocks and colourless coral but there were quite a few different types of fish there including some HUGE angel fish very very nice spot and yes the jelly fish are here now,1
What is the best place now in Qatar to spend the Eid holidays,Best places are Fuwarait beach  swim striaght out and there are lots of corals different fish sea greass beds and sea snakes If your really lucky turtles Anywhere north of Ras Laffan should be good I was at Umm Tais Natural Reserves mentioned in post above  turn right at AlShammal and head east first island is Ras Rakkan and is harder to get to go past until a hamlet and past this you can access Umm Tais a few weeks ago interesting place but Fuwarait is easier to get to etc Sandy beach we used to go to AlDhakriah mangroves There is generally less to see on west coast than the east coast unless you go to places near construction which for the east coast is now a lot Hence i recommend French beach  fuwarait There are also a few nice locations you can snorkell in the inland sea although currents at certain times are very very strong GO past coastguard station at mouth and head along towards Saudi until you see obvious shallows,1
What is the best place now in Qatar to spend the Eid holidays,From what you all have said Fuwarait beach is a perfect place to explore to enjoy and witness its natural reserves Thanks for the share Im really waiting and seeking for answers of where to go and spend for our weekend vacation and adventure hawaii snorkeling tours,1

Im likely to travel in the month of june just wanna know some good places to visit,I went snorkelling two days ago off the coast of Dukhan about  km to the right of the Water Sports Club near to the Desalination plant Some massive rocks and colourless coral but there were quite a few different types of fish there including some HUGE angel fish very very nice spot and yes the jelly fish are here now,0
Im likely to travel in the month of june just wanna know some good places to visit,Best places are Fuwarait beach  swim striaght out and there are lots of corals different fish sea greass beds and sea snakes If your really lucky turtles Anywhere north of Ras Laffan should be good I was at Umm Tais Natural Reserves mentioned in post above  turn right at AlShammal and head east first island is Ras Rakkan and is harder to get to go past until a hamlet and past this you can access Umm Tais a few weeks ago interesting place but Fuwarait is easier to get to etc Sandy beach we used to go to AlDhakriah mangroves There is generally less to see on west coast than the east coast unless you go to places near construction which for the east coast is now a lot Hence i recommend French beach  fuwarait There are also a few nice locations you can snorkell in the inland sea although currents at certain times are very very strong GO past coastguard station at mouth and head along towards Saudi until you see obvious shallows,1
Im likely to travel in the month of june just wanna know some good places to visit,From what you all have said Fuwarait beach is a perfect place to explore to enjoy and witness its natural reserves Thanks for the share Im really waiting and seeking for answers of where to go and spend for our weekend vacation and adventure hawaii snorkeling tours,0

Can Anyone tell me prices of new German cars in Qatar and deals available Thanks,well i dont have any idea about renault costs but what i can tell you with full belief and accuracy is that NOTHING comes close to the reliability and low maintenance costs of japanese cars especially toyota they just keep going on and on and on and if you stick to the basic recommended maintenance schedule toyotas could run forever hahai saw a toyota camry few days back which had been driven  kmsthat is absolutely and unbelievably high mileageand the car was ten years oldi could not believe how smooth and quiet it wasall the owner did was take good care of the engine and change oil regularly because he drove a lotif maintenance and cost and reliability is a concern for you then japanese cars are the way to go best of luck,0
Can Anyone tell me prices of new German cars in Qatar and deals available Thanks,Peace be upon you and how do you do First of all when you live in any Arabian Gulf countries and thinking to buy a car then it is better to buy a Japanese car as first choice However if you are still new in here and just started working and wants to invest your money in a car then buy a small Japanese SedanSaloon car as it could save you a lot of money more than any other european cars specailly here in the Arabian Gulf as there is not much of experienced good workshops to make maintinane and fix your european car in the future SO either you go to Mitsubishi cars or Toyota but Nissan is the last choice as I heared that their workshop is very busy and costing more money so do Renault which could cost you much more than Nissan Nevertheless no one is going to push you away from the car that you would love to buy but as an advice from a person who has been living in Qatar for  years and had and experince with many types of cars then it is better for you to think more ,0

Any one tell me how to drive to LU LU from TV RA,No public library it has yet to get off the ground and just the one bookshop If youre a booklover youll be disappointed The paperbacks seem to be reasonably priced but I thought the prices of some of the hardbacks were rather inflated Theres always Amazon,0
Any one tell me how to drive to LU LU from TV RA,And if you read anything other than fiction your choice will be fairly limited,0
Any one tell me how to drive to LU LU from TV RA,Hi there Loki is right no major book stores here except for a saudiowned franchise called Jarir You might find a few of the latest paperbooks but its a rather dismal selection if you are a book lover and are used to stacked shelves that you see at Chapters Borders or Barnes  Noble Best bet is Amazon and picking up books from Dubai Btw  I am a member of a book club and there are several more If you are interested in joining shoot me an email on exochochotmailcom,0
Any one tell me how to drive to LU LU from TV RA,one book store is slightly unfair Youll find a selection of popular cheap paperbacks at Carrefour Lulu Hypermarket and some of the selfstyled bookshops Theres a small reading library at Garveys but most of the English readers I know stock up at LHR departures and then swop amongst themselves Doha Players had most of the old British Council selection but of course that was destroyed by the bomb,0
Any one tell me how to drive to LU LU from TV RA,One bookshop is in no way an unfair assessment The supermarkets may have a few books on their shelves but that doesnt make them bookshops and anyway are they books you would want to buy Look at the bestseller list on Amazon How many of these books can you find in the supermarkets Come to that how many can you find in Jarir,0

which is the best place to walk or jogg in qatar ofcos corniche is there but isnt there anything quieter and calmner,Bibs your topic message above is not really accurately describing safety in Qatar This instance that happened with your wife almost happens almost everywhere in other countries If I am taking a cab in Cairo where I live I will get tons of offers to hop into someones car Not necessarily because I am pretty but because girls are hit on generally speaking Ive been here in Doha for a couple of years with family or without faced the usual hassles Downsides Persistent car followers At malls guys throw their cell phone numbers at girls In bars some guys impose themselves but usually there are guards On the beach guys stare and offer company with no pressure On the Cornich for long walks jogging and workouts guys may try to talk to her But if the girl is serious enough no one can catch up with here speed to begin with unless he is a highly athletic trainer or something Generally men stare specifically from certain down trodden expats from some least deve,0

which is the best place to walk or jogg in qatar ofcos corniche is there but isnt there anything quieter and calmner,I am more than surprised to see all these comments living and working in Qatar as a blond woman I have to admit I have never encountered any of the above mentioned Even going to the Fruit and Vegetable Market where in any case it is much better if you have company with you not because people stare but they are used to dealing with men as mostly on Friday the men do the shopping Wherever you go if they recognise you are foreignerbecause you are different they will look at you and the inflation will rise  in every shop at least they will try Qatar is no different than any other country but a lot more safe if you behave naturally you will not be molested One thing more  on the streets it is very much a mans world and your will see relatively few women going alone shopping so for many people this is really strange I go to a small supermarket nearly everyday to buy milk and the boy insists on carrying the one bottle to my car this alway makes me feel foolish as I am,0
What do you think about it After paying for the membership fee we still have to pay for the entrance fee Is it fair enough,If you enjoy filipino cover bands and lots of asian variety in the crowd then the Qube is GREAT however if you enjoy more of the western flair you are down to Garveys Rugby Club and Rydges Of these your best bet for Fri and Sat night my OPINION so no flames from anyone is going to be Rydges The bar is under new Aussie management with the goal of MUCH better music and faster service This past weekend was quite busy and the music was good enough to dance to So there you hav it one recommendation,0

What do you think about it After paying for the membership fee we still have to pay for the entrance fee Is it fair enough,To the majority of people whom have attended real clubs go for the music to get dressed up to impress not only others but themselves Many clubs are just institutions to carry on drinking after normal club closing time and to pick up members of the opposite sex Real clubbingIS music dancing not what has been described on here This is not just my opinion there are many clubbing web pages and you will find it hard pressed to find a description of what is described on this forum Have you ever been to Ibiza granted the drug scene is far to prevalent there but it is all about fun music and dancing not about picking up women,0

I am loooking into hiring a car with a driver have heard some agencies here in DOha do itany tips Many thanks,Beware I think you will find that the car is covered for accidents but not people in the car You may need to take out seperate insurance for the passengers Fully comprehensive in Qatar is not the same as fully comprehensive in the UK,0
I am loooking into hiring a car with a driver have heard some agencies here in DOha do itany tips Many thanks,Car Insurance is quite different from Western practices As noted above you insure the car not the driver which is one of the reasons kids here can afford to drive massive landcruisers despite the slaughter of pedestrians Blood money for nonMoslems is pretty minimal anyway For cars over a certain age  years Dunno rd party is the only option however and again as noted above cover for passengers is not automatic so check these things carefully with your Insurance Broker Even the possibility of having residual alocohol in your bloodstream when some idiot slams into you some morning has to be specifically covered so its not a bad idea to go to a reputable international Insurance company if you think you might occasionally have nonfamily passengers or drink beer of an evening,0
I am loooking into hiring a car with a driver have heard some agencies here in DOha do itany tips Many thanks,When you take out full insurance you will normally be offered the choice of insuring the driver and exnumber you chose of passengers Additionally as stated you can insure against being over the limit excess alcohol although I do not know what would happen if a driver was drunk and had an accident,0

I am loooking into hiring a car with a driver have heard some agencies here in DOha do itany tips Many thanks,Hey fitri We moved here Oct  from Dallas and it took roughly  days for our furniture and household goods to arrive Im not sure about your second question As far as I know the shipment made its way to us shortly after it arrived and had cleared customs so we never stored it I suppose it would have been nice to send it  months in advance of our arrival though,0

I am loooking into hiring a car with a driver have heard some agencies here in DOha do itany tips Many thanks,I believe that the shipping company in the states coordinated with one of the local moving companies and handled most of the paperwork When our shipment arrived we simply had to find the moving company here and give them a map on where to deliver the goods There may have been other steps handled by my wife or her company but it seemed fairly straightforward Your employer andor moving company should give adequate instructions Be aware that they may quarantine and return later anything that they think needs to be reviewed for content like DVDs VHS tapes books CDs etc It seems our labeling of boxes helped them in this effort and so some of our DVDs that were in the labeled boxes arrived after quarantine while others that were just haphazardly packed were delivered on the first shipment httpwwwxangacomBBetz,0

What do you think of it,Its not that China it was deleted because the thread was trolling and promoting prostitution such threads that promote something whether it was prostitution or otherwise gets deleted But it wasnt cause of the topic itself so we can continue here ,0
What do you think of it,thats why it was deleted I was the one who reported it to Qatari Nevertheless the thread was becoming interesting Im sorry  May the roof above us never fall in and may the friends below never fall out,0
What do you think of it,So lets talk about it here  Im surprised that prostitution is that open in what is considered a conservative country I mean if its so obvious that these women are prostituting them then Im sure authorities know about itthe question iswhy arent they doing anything about it ,0
What do you think of it,OK thats understandable thank you It also underlines mir and my point that we believed prostitution is less tolerable here in Qatar However the fact remains that prostitution is wide spread in certain places in Qatar and thrives until something is said by somebody and then the routine mass deportations take place It goes quiet for a while and then the night girls start building up in numbers again to the level they are now My last sentence before the previous thread was deleted was something like this mark my words the ladies will vanish any day now Over the few weeks after that their numbers will slowly increase again and the cycle repeats its self Obviously somebody is behind this a pimp as a sponsor for these girls,0
What do you think of it,If someone is actually behind this which I believe so it has to be someone in a high position someone who has control over authoritieswhat other explanation is there for the lack of action by the authorities ,0
What do you think of it,Cornellian somebody answered this on the previous thread just before it was deleted I cannot recall the poster but it was suggested that some body in authority possible with some wasta to throw around was probably behind it My apologies if I have not recalled what was said precisely but I would go along with that theory anyway There are just far too many girls far too often in so many places for it to be anything else Unless somebody knows differently ofcourse ,0
What do you think of it,looks like we are on the same wave length here I would guess that the authorities are bending to a certain extent under the threat of this persons wasta The final breaking point is probably reached when the religious fraternity start to objectspeak out,0
What do you think of it,Arrrggghhhh my country is going to the dogs Oh well you know what they sayif you cant beatem joinem JK P,0
What do you think of it,But if that pimp is powerful enough to keep the authorities quiet then he must be powerful enough to keep the religious fraternity too I think no matter what anyone says or does prostitution will always exist everywhere because there will always be women who need the money and men who are ready to pay,0
What do you think of it,who join who did u acknowledge what china syndrome said i meant as your point of view as a local,0
What do you think of it,If you enjoy filipino cover bands and lots of asian variety in the crowd then the Qube is GREAT however if you enjoy more of the western flair you are down to Garveys Rugby Club and Rydges Of these your best bet for Fri and Sat night my OPINION so no flames from anyone is going to be Rydges The bar is under new Aussie management with the goal of MUCH better music and faster service This past weekend was quite busy and the music was good enough to dance to So there you hav it one recommendation,0
What do you think of it,Go to beirut thats where the clubing is I always tell the truth even when I lie,0
What do you think of it,Is pretty good on a Thursday night Nice crowd of people and a good British band Not clubbing though For clubbing there is only the Pearl with the awful DJ JoJO and Cloud Nyn where the crowd is very very young I guess if you want clubbing you really do have to go to Beirut,0
What do you think of it,Not good idea to come to have a party in Qatar Qatar is a Muslim country Muslims are not allowed to drink alcohol  be in unnecessary coed places Coming to Qatar to have party is strange Maybe you could save money for other purposes other than parties,0
What do you think of it,I agree with Tyler and bbksiu Although the best way to enjoy your weekend in Doha is by get together with friends in one of our house have dinner bbq and drinks alcohol you can buy alcohol if you have the license play some games eg Risk and Card watch the latest dvd you can put music on and DANCE Becareful your neighbor and if you too drunk to go home your friend can get you a lift or there always a taxi So you not worry to get cought on drunk and driving,0
What do you think of it,Someone agrees with me That NEVER happens perhaps I took my mediaction today and had a rare lucid thought P,0
What do you think of it,Amaru Immortal  Clubs I mean night clubs here in Qatar are no comparison to what youd find in a nonmuslim country They both serve alcohol have music livedjs but thats where the comparison ends Where would you go for RnB and hiphop Take a plane and go somewhere else  Id suggest Heat or Mercury Lounge in Melbourne for RnBHip Hop  Bit of promotion from an exemployee If you still wanna come to the Middle East for clubbing go to Beirut or Istanbul Maybe even Cairo for that matter Or go to Goa India if you wanna spend Xmas at trance parties on the beaches Or go pub hopping in Bangalore I hear that in Qatar nobody goes out on saturday is that true True We go out on Thursdays Thats the weekend here Happy hour starts at pm,0
What do you think of it,it sucks,0

Will miss you all Have a great time as always All the Best God Bless Signing Out,Ahhhh Cyberdiver has a point Your RP has not been processed therefore you do not have a sponsor yet Therefore I think you have been working illegally here for the duration,0

Will miss you all Have a great time as always All the Best God Bless Signing Out,But try to be clear from all these before coming here Welcome to Qatar,0
Will miss you all Have a great time as always All the Best God Bless Signing Out,Is the medical exam result always takes  working days beacuse my colleague did the fingerprinting  weeks after his medical exam and he said the medical exam result takes  weeks And the only thing for him to know if he passed the medical exam is because he did the fingerprinting process And is there anyway to know if you pass the medical exam,0
Will miss you all Have a great time as always All the Best God Bless Signing Out,Once you are done w ur medical exam you can check w the medical commission at least after  working days Just show your receipt number or passport copy at the male counter section and youll get to know if its ready or not For a medical employees it usually takes about  wks to have the results done due to other test ei creatinine test that has to be sent to HMC for investigations In your case you are only required to undergo blood testHIV  Chest XrayPTB so i think it wont take long that much Dont you have mandooprepresentative for your company he is supposed to follow up all these things and you can always check w him Good Luck,0

I need help to contact American or Baptist Churches in Doha,What do u mean by converting No one will be converted into Christianity unless the person is expressed his wish by himself to become a Christian And no one will stop you entering any of the churches in the world I hope so for praying or to be with the Lord for sometime,0

I need help to contact American or Baptist Churches in Doha,I believed that Christian Churches are limited in Qatar because a permission has to be approved and grant by the government just like I think what was happened in Catholic Church and other Christian Churches besides Converting means from your own self There is no hardway if you are sincere of going inside and converting to any religion Just an opinion,1
I need help to contact American or Baptist Churches in Doha,Yes There are many other Christian churches in Doha The best part is all of them are in the same compound now,1

I need help to contact American or Baptist Churches in Doha,the second stanza was a misleadibg question but as what i undesrtand the question was  if there is any other christian churches are they difficult to attend to meaning are they recognized by the STATE OF QATAR For the information only few sect of christians are recognized here on of which is catholic others  who are not recognized are not allowed to have a meeting or fellowship otherwise the police has the right to intervene,0

I need help to contact American or Baptist Churches in Doha,I care about a person based on their person not their belief granted last thing i want to hear is preaching but if someone is trying to convert rather than accept the way i am i dont constitute them as a good person ,0

I need help to contact American or Baptist Churches in Doha,I always had a feeling that I had Qatari blood in me ,0
I need help to contact American or Baptist Churches in Doha,Expat schools here at least the Western ones DO teach Arabic And Islamic studies Islamic studies only for Muslims of course They also teach Qatari history and that is mandatory for all students Well at least the school my child goes to does I do not know about the non Western Expat schools,0
I need help to contact American or Baptist Churches in Doha,they should do that why should i care about is he muslim or notu came to a muslim country islamic country nothing is gonna happen to ur dear child if he learns somethign except christianity maybe it will be too much for their ignorant brains but it should be like that i was born in germany and i went to church and i went to religious classes like all the other kids did if u dont like it here u can leave but the minimum of respect is to send the child to learn about sharia and arabic arabic is the language of the past and of the futurebut i know where their problem isaffraid ur chidlren will convert will like it,0
I need help to contact American or Baptist Churches in Doha,Arabic is a very good idea since it is the local languagenot so sure about Shariawhy should nonMuslim kids there are thousands of them here right be forced to study Sharia,0
I need help to contact American or Baptist Churches in Doha,The way I look at it is like this My child is enrolled in a Western school My child is not Muslim Of course he should learn about Islam but not as something he needs to submit to but something he should have knowledge about The same goes for Sharia law We do indeed live in an Islamic country so it is important to be familiar with Islam I like that Arabic is taught the more languages a person knowsthe better The only problem I have is that so far all the Arabic teachers we encountered are totally useless,0
I need help to contact American or Baptist Churches in Doha,study Arabic or Islamic studies which I understand from a Qatari friend includes an introduction to sharia After all isnt the basis of education to prepare one for life by providing a broadbased foundation from which one can later choose a specialty to focus on Besides I thought this was implemented from last year by the MOE,0
I need help to contact American or Baptist Churches in Doha,hey here is my best friend putting his nose again in everythinghow r u today dear how is ur scarecrow,0
I need help to contact American or Baptist Churches in Doha,Arabic Sharia law Qatar history plus Islamic history should be taught at all school as a compulsory subjects to Muslim students  optional to nonmuslims Only if they wish to,0
I need help to contact American or Baptist Churches in Doha,Isobel said RE  In order to teach religion effectively there has to be comparatives What I mean by this when explaining to children the various nuances of religious beliefs one has to show a comparative and what that comparative means to that particular religion If we are going to go down the route of teaching religion in this country we are going to have teach ALL religions in order to get the history culture and meanings of what each religion means to that particular one and how in some cases some religions are tied to each other through geographical circumstances and culture and how indeed they came to be that Religion There will have to be healthy debate and in some cases at High School level debate as in eg Islam and Christianity Would that work I think in expat schools it may but in some local private schools I doubt it However if by religious education they mean telling a few stories from Koran to incite a healthy interest in the local religion it could work,0
I need help to contact American or Baptist Churches in Doha,I cant think of a good argument against learning the language of ones host nation provided as Isobel said that a student can handle the academic rigors of such a class Sharia Id personally have a problem with that being mandatory Because Sharia is a code of law based upon a specific religion it would only be acceptable to me if it were taught as an elective comparative law class say for high school students Then it would be appropriate If instead of Sharia you meant they should be teaching all children IslamiyatIslamic Studies classes then youd get a vehement NO from me Unless youre going to couch it in a comparative religion class that EVERYONE has to take then why should my child have to sit through a class that will amount to nothing more than religious indoctrination to a faith that I dont subscribe to I would be more than happy for my child to take a class on history of the Middle East and the Islamic World or Arab cultural studies and much like an A,0

I need help to contact American or Baptist Churches in Doha,The chicken or the egg causality dilemma arises from the expression which came first the chicken or the egg Chickens hatch from eggs but eggs are laid by chickens making it difficult to say which originally gave rise to the other To ancient philosophers the question about the first chicken or egg also evoked the questions of how life and the universe in general began  Cultural references to the chicken and egg intend to point out the futility of identifying the first case of a circular cause and consequence,0
I need help to contact American or Baptist Churches in Doha,In a manner of avoiding the question or joking it can be said that the chicken came firstin the structure of the question simply because the words the chicken are said before the words the egg when the question is asked In a question that is phrased differently the answer would be different Similarly Randy Garner jokingly refers to an encyclopedic solution  These supporters call attention to the MerriamWebster Collegiate Dictionary  Upon careful examination of the entries and accompanying definitions one can accurately assert that chicken is found on page  while egg is not found until page  Therefore according to this argument chicken clearly comes before egg ,0

More handsome and attractive who Pakistani guys or Indian guys,Life is not easy if you are a Western Woman and the main reason a man from this part of the world would want a western woman is mainly for sex However please do not for one moment think that the men and women here cont have premarital relationships  they do it just not talked about and it is not caried out in the open Due to the conservative background of the boys they will always return to their families and it would be vry difficult for them to marry outside the families would not be happy about it I think it is much better to be very cautious out here although there are a great many handsome men and they can be very charming going through the Arab and Asian world of men they are all interested in SEX One of the things is that being found to be together whoc ae not married can get into very deep trouble here  just a little food for thought,0
More handsome and attractive who Pakistani guys or Indian guys,Sadly this has been the case for many years Maybe it originally stems from the days when arabs had loads of money visited capital cities mainly in the West and were naturally surrounded as they were rich by hookers Word spread when they returned that they had been with western women The assumption would then be made that all Western women were loose That is the assumption that we came to many years ago Rather like the Western men going to Thailand,0

how many of you logon to QL after your working hours,without government approval of your marriage you wont get a family visa back into Qatar unfortunately Marrying you out of the country can cause major problems for your fiance so I would suggest you wait until your marriage is approved The only other option is that you relocate somewhere else marry there but your marriage will not be valid in Qatar and you will have no claim to any inheritences if god forbid something should happen to him Does your fiance not have some Wasta that can obtain your release from your company I am not saying that will make things any easier since you still need to have the govt approval for marriage but at least you can be in Qatar near him,1
how many of you logon to QL after your working hours,filqatar im sure she is just naiv for sure he is married and his family will accept her  never believe me their pride is number   ufff i wish girls dont trust them so easily and dont beleieve them everything bhut what to do,0

can you find cheerios in Doha,aljazeera is an equal opportunity company so your nationality should not matter I also got a job offer there and am still waiting to finalize things I already visited the company and I was thrilled with the place and the employees they are extremely nice and helpful which you dont really find in much TV stations so it is a blessing As per your concern about accomodation from what I heard is that all employees who are married and have children are provided with a very decent villa in a compound and single employees are provided with a  bdrm furnished apartment in a nice place as well After all aljazeera has a big name and I dont think they will throw their employeestheir best resources in a place that is unfit or unsafe Good luck and I hope to see you there,0

can you find cheerios in Doha,Hi Folks I am starting work in Doha in August and I was wondering if anyone knows if it is possible to transfer my UAE license to a Qatar one My Canadian license has long since expired but I have been on my UAE license for the past  years I would rather not deal with the hassle of redoing my Canada license this summer but I bet it would be simpler than doing the Qatari driving exam Anyone have any experience with this Cheers,0
can you find cheerios in Doha,I am not sure about people from the UK asthey are driving on the left hand side of the road However there are other expats here who are driving they will probably know about it I converted mine from the UAE as I cant find my European license and that went no bother at all,0
can you find cheerios in Doha,first of all you have to get your residence permit afterwhich you can apply for a qatar driving license if you already have a driving license from your country take note that most of the western countries they will just convert it no need for you to take up the test or go to a driving school if your license is from asia it depends but most of the asian license you have to undergo a driving test signal L and pocket parking road test or the traffice department will suggest on your application form to go to a driving school for two weeks hope this helps,0
can you find cheerios in Doha,as far as i know theres no problem with you converting a uae license to a qatari one i know a lot of people have done it the only test you will have to undergo is the eye test and they will be more than happy to convert your license to a qatari one ,0
can you find cheerios in Doha,You can drive on a international drivers for six months no problem and when you do a visa run it starts again,0
can you find cheerios in Doha,I had a omani license and no rp as it was taking time I went to traffic department and they gave me a temp license after eye test and said once you get rp we will convert that into permenant license As far as I know and I might be wrong if you come to qatar on residence visa you can only drive for  days before converting your license into qatari temp visit visa is another story Beast,0

where is the best drinking in qatar for americans men looking to meet women,yes you can drink in hotel bars or get a liqour license and you have a ration per month depending on your salary,1
where is the best drinking in qatar for americans men looking to meet women,Licenses are for purchasing alcohol from Qatar Distribution Company To get it you require Salary Certificate from your company with the following details Basic SalaryMin  Wether company providing accomodationelse mention allowance details Thats all it takes Religion doesnt matter ,1
where is the best drinking in qatar for americans men looking to meet women,So say that you get a license does that mean you can drink at any bar What is the normal limit for a contractor,0
where is the best drinking in qatar for americans men looking to meet women,A license to purchase alcohol means you buy booze from QDC and drink in your house You dont need a license to drink in a bar,1
where is the best drinking in qatar for americans men looking to meet women,And for your information RELIGION does matter no Muslims are given alcohol permits,0
where is the best drinking in qatar for americans men looking to meet women,depends on how much the contractor can drink ,0
where is the best drinking in qatar for americans men looking to meet women,If a contractor gets a license and decides to drink at a bar they can go to any bar,0
where is the best drinking in qatar for americans men looking to meet women,smoke  paleezz dont rub that bull shit here  I am one and i have my license Why bother  why dont you call QDC urself to find out ,0
where is the best drinking in qatar for americans men looking to meet women,I didnt know they suddenly changed the rules for muslims to buy booze,0
where is the best drinking in qatar for americans men looking to meet women,Well I dont know what QDC is Also I am asking because all I know is I was told that you had to get a license to drink,0
where is the best drinking in qatar for americans men looking to meet women,Well in my opinion Almanhal is the bestabout home delivery that you have to check with them but I guess there shouldnt be a problem if ur prepared to order some good nos,0
where is the best drinking in qatar for americans men looking to meet women,Al Manhal Water Factory Co LTd WLL tel ,0
where is the best drinking in qatar for americans men looking to meet women,Rayyan claim to be the ONLY company in Qatar who supply  gallon MINERAL water,0
where is the best drinking in qatar for americans men looking to meet women,yeah sabeel is the best supplier and also the water tastes better i had tried manhal beforesorry to say worst service and the water is just like any other tap water i tried few other water like aqua cool and safa not so great rayyan is an exception but little too expensive anyways i am happy with sabeel and dont intend to change even if they increase their price so i strongly recommend sabeel water tel no contact their sales manager by the name Anil very helpful he will set up a service for you and dont forget to give my name as ref as i will get two free bottles just kidding,0
where is the best drinking in qatar for americans men looking to meet women,Nestle are very good and reliableph,0
where is the best drinking in qatar for americans men looking to meet women,AL JAZEERA PURE DRINKING WATER is also the best Their containers are all new Their service staffs were polite They have a timely deliveries so you wont worry wether youre out or still have spare containers left not consumed They will only replenish your empty containers No more to hurry for calling them at time you have water shortages Besides they are offering one free standing Water Cooler dispenser for free upon your first time availment of buying  booklet water coupons At a cost of QAR for pcs gallon bottles its worth more than a service and the pure healthy water I just had availed of it two weeks ago i have a new cooler dispenser now Call them at TEl  Fax  or email them at infoaljazeerawatercom for more queries simply call ANWAR HUSSAIN with mobile  for additional info I highly recommend AL JAZEErA WATER for you,0
where is the best drinking in qatar for americans men looking to meet women,I would not totally agree with sajaryan saying that Almanhal is like tap waterits one of the best but I do agree that sabeel is goodcos we have the brand in our office and its distibuted by international Water Co WLL,0
where is the best drinking in qatar for americans men looking to meet women,NOT Nestle water Although their water tastes good their service is horrible Plus they are at least  riyals more expensive per bottle than other companies,0
where is the best drinking in qatar for americans men looking to meet women,yes Hukk is right nestle is not good with their service infact i came to know that manhal and nestle belongs to the same group manhal does the filling for nestle no wonder why they have such lousy service to answer MrVengal i dont agree that manhal is the best if u r using a dispenser with their bottle you will be surprised to see red color plastic pieces inside the water tank and at times it is visible in your glass too when you pour the water out from the faucet thats coz the red caps what they use on their bottles are not spill proof when u put the bottle upside down on your dispenser the cap gets punctured and blows into pieces and it ends up in your water i guess only rayyan and sabeel uses spill proof caps and hence its safe,0
where is the best drinking in qatar for americans men looking to meet women,too bad you guys havent found Nestle reliable ive been using them for  months and they have never failed Infact a couple of times id forgotten to take the bottles out and wasnt homeas they ususally knock if you dont leave the bottles out and ive rang them and they hav come the next day to deliverI guess everyone has different experiences,0
where is the best drinking in qatar for americans men looking to meet women,If you enjoy filipino cover bands and lots of asian variety in the crowd then the Qube is GREAT however if you enjoy more of the western flair you are down to Garveys Rugby Club and Rydges Of these your best bet for Fri and Sat night my OPINION so no flames from anyone is going to be Rydges The bar is under new Aussie management with the goal of MUCH better music and faster service This past weekend was quite busy and the music was good enough to dance to So there you hav it one recommendation,1
where is the best drinking in qatar for americans men looking to meet women,Go to beirut thats where the clubing is I always tell the truth even when I lie,0
where is the best drinking in qatar for americans men looking to meet women,Is pretty good on a Thursday night Nice crowd of people and a good British band Not clubbing though For clubbing there is only the Pearl with the awful DJ JoJO and Cloud Nyn where the crowd is very very young I guess if you want clubbing you really do have to go to Beirut,1
where is the best drinking in qatar for americans men looking to meet women,Not good idea to come to have a party in Qatar Qatar is a Muslim country Muslims are not allowed to drink alcohol  be in unnecessary coed places Coming to Qatar to have party is strange Maybe you could save money for other purposes other than parties,0
where is the best drinking in qatar for americans men looking to meet women,I agree with Tyler and bbksiu Although the best way to enjoy your weekend in Doha is by get together with friends in one of our house have dinner bbq and drinks alcohol you can buy alcohol if you have the license play some games eg Risk and Card watch the latest dvd you can put music on and DANCE Becareful your neighbor and if you too drunk to go home your friend can get you a lift or there always a taxi So you not worry to get cought on drunk and driving,0
where is the best drinking in qatar for americans men looking to meet women,Someone agrees with me That NEVER happens perhaps I took my mediaction today and had a rare lucid thought P,0
where is the best drinking in qatar for americans men looking to meet women,Amaru Immortal  Clubs I mean night clubs here in Qatar are no comparison to what youd find in a nonmuslim country They both serve alcohol have music livedjs but thats where the comparison ends Where would you go for RnB and hiphop Take a plane and go somewhere else  Id suggest Heat or Mercury Lounge in Melbourne for RnBHip Hop  Bit of promotion from an exemployee If you still wanna come to the Middle East for clubbing go to Beirut or Istanbul Maybe even Cairo for that matter Or go to Goa India if you wanna spend Xmas at trance parties on the beaches Or go pub hopping in Bangalore I hear that in Qatar nobody goes out on saturday is that true True We go out on Thursdays Thats the weekend here Happy hour starts at pm,1
where is the best drinking in qatar for americans men looking to meet women,it sucks,0

where is the best drinking in qatar for americans men looking to meet women,Hi I strongly recommend Evian Its a bit more expensive than other water but its worth it and you find it in all Carrefours You can never be sure about other producers here unfortunatelyif you decide to go for another brand make sure Sodium content is less than  We just arrived here a month ago from the UK too and my  months old is on Evian My  year old was also on it when she was little Also what formula are you using they are not always identical to UK ones I tried Nestles NAN but it gave her green poo so we switched to Aptamil and she seems to be fine now I dont know if its your first baby but in case it is  dont worry to much about what is so called recommended milk intake is  both my daughters always took at least  less than was recommended for their age and their weight has still been absolutely normal Feel free to send me a personal message if you need more advice,0
